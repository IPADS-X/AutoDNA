I've been meticulously analyzing the error message. This points directly to a potential issue within the fluorometer's execution, likely triggered by empty containers. I've now incorporated the necessary robot commands to move the sample tubes to and from the fluorometer before and after each measurement. This includes the initial reading at time zero and the readings throughout the incubation cycles.
