{"content": "I will use the `Literature` agent to search for methods to decode a list of DNA sequences into a sentence, which will help me understand the encoding scheme and develop a decoding algorithm.\n\nMy reasoning for choosing the `Literature` agent is that the user has not provided a decoding method, and I need to find a common or standard way to convert the given DNA sequences into a meaningful sentence. The `Literature` agent is the most appropriate tool for this purpose as it can search scientific literature and documents to answer specific questions.\n\nI am filling the `questions` parameter with \"How to decode a list of DNA sequences into a sentence?\" and \"What are the common methods for encoding text into DNA sequences?\" because these questions are direct and will help me gather the necessary information to solve the problem. I am providing \"DNA Data Decoding\" as the `experiment_name` to give context to the search. This will help the agent focus on relevant information and provide a more accurate and useful response.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Literature", "args": {"experiment_name": "DNA Data Decoding", "questions": ["How to decode a list of DNA sequences into a sentence?", "What are the common methods for encoding text into DNA sequences?"]}, "id": "d6a3df09-689c-4b8a-8f7d-f43c2db4522e", "type": "tool_call"}]}
