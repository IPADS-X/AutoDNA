{"content": "I have already completed the necessary steps of literature search, protocol generation, and code generation. Now, I will proceed with executing the generated code to decode the DNA sequences into a sentence.\n\nI will use the `Hardware` agent for this purpose. The `file_ids` parameter will be set to the ID of the code file I just generated. Since this decoding process is deterministic and does not require multiple runs, I will set the `repeat_num` to 1. As this is a purely computational task involving no physical hardware, the `pure_software` parameter will be set to `True`. This setup ensures that the code is executed correctly to obtain the final decoded sentence.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Hardware", "args": {"file_ids": ["Code-f812"], "repeat_num": 1.0, "pure_software": true}, "id": "27696681-5b67-47d9-8b69-6fc8e052c32b", "type": "tool_call"}]}
