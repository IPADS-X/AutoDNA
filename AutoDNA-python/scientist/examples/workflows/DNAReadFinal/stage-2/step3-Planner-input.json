The `Literature` agent is the most appropriate tool for this purpose as it can search scientific literature and documents to answer specific questions.\n\nI am filling the `questions` parameter with \"How to decode a list of DNA sequences into a sentence?\" and \"What are the common methods for encoding text into DNA sequences?\" because these questions are direct and will help me gather the necessary information to solve the problem.

This approach leverages DNA's high data density (Kosuri2014 pages 6-7).\n\n### Encoding Methodology\n\nCommon methods for encoding digital information into DNA sequences utilize large DNA oligonucleotide (oligo) pools (Kosuri2014 pages 6-7, Kosuri2014 pages 8-10). The design of encoding rules can accommodate error rates or avoid specific sequence motifs that might pose challenges for synthesis or sequencing technologies (Hoose2023 pages 14-15). The genetic alphabet can also be expanded to eight Hachimoji bases, allowing for an exponential increase in data density with engineered enzymes (Hoose2023 pages 14-15).\n\nA specific encoding methodology involves several steps:\n1.  **Data Conversion: Binary to Ternary** The source data is first converted into a single, long binary stream, which is then transformed into its ternary equivalent, forming the foundational data sequence (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n2.  **Segmentation and Homopolymer Avoidance** This long ternary sequence is partitioned into smaller, manageable segments. The conversion from ternary digits (trits) to DNA bases is specifically designed to prevent homopolymers (consecutive runs of the same base), which are a significant source of synthesis and sequencing errors (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n3.  **DNA Strand Structure** Each 8-base-long DNA strand is structured to include indexing trits, data trits, and an error correction trit. The error correction trit's value is calculated for each segment by summing the corresponding source trits (both index and data) and taking the result modulo 3 (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n4.  **Encoding Initialization** To ensure consistent encoding, the first base of every DNA strand is processed with a fixed initial condition, treating the preceding base as 'G'. Any necessary padding is applied at the beginning (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n5.  **Ternary-to-Base Conversion Rules** The conversion from ternary digits to DNA bases follows specific rules that depend on the preceding base to prevent homopolymer formation (Encoding2025 pages 1-2):\n    *   If the previous base is A, a ternary digit of 0 converts to T, 1 to C, and 2 to G.\n    *   If the previous base is T, a ternary digit of 0 converts to A, 1 to C, and 2 to G.\n    *   If the previous base is C, a ternary digit of 0 converts to A, 1 to T, and 2 to G.\n    *   If the previous base is G, a ternary digit of 0 converts to A, 1 to T, and 2 to C (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n\n### Decoding and Data Retrieval\n\nThe retrieval of original information, or DNA decoding, directly reverses the encoding steps to reconstruct the initial binary data (Encoding2025 pages 1-2). This process requires accurate sequencing technology (Hoose2023 pages 14-15).\n\nThe decoding process for the described methodology would involve:\n1.  **DNA Sequencing** The DNA sequences are read using an accurate sequencing technology. For example, in the Heliscope sequencer, individual library fragments with poly(dA) tails are captured by hybridization to oligo(dT) molecules covalently bound to a glass surface (Shendure2011 pages 16-17).\n2.  **Base-to-Ternary Conversion** The sequenced DNA bases are converted back into ternary digits by reversing the Ternary-to-Base Conversion Rules, considering the preceding base.\n3.  **Trit Extraction and Error Correction** From each 8-base-long DNA strand, the indexing trits, data trits, and error correction trit are extracted. The error correction trit is then used to verify data integrity by recalculating the sum of index and data trits modulo 3 and comparing it to the stored error correction trit.\n4.  **Ternary to Binary Conversion** The reconstructed long ternary sequence is converted back into its binary equivalent.\n5.  **Data Reconstruction** The binary data is then used to reconstruct the original digital information, such as a sentence (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n The information has been saved to the file: Literature-dee0"]}
