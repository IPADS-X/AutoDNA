{"content": "I will use the `Protocol` agent to outline the steps for decoding the provided DNA sequences. This will serve as a blueprint for the subsequent code generation.\n\nThe `Protocol` agent is the most suitable choice here because it is designed to generate experimental procedures and algorithms. In this case, I am asking it to create a decoding algorithm based on the information I've gathered.\n\nI am providing the following parameters to the `Protocol` agent:\n- `experiment_name`: \"DNA Data Decoding\" - This is the high-level goal of the current stage.\n- `file_ids`: `['Literature-dee0']` - This file contains the detailed information about the encoding and decoding methodology that I found using the `Literature` agent. The `Protocol` agent will use this information to construct the decoding procedure.\n- `pure_software`: `True` - This is a purely computational task, so I am setting this flag to `True`.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"experiment_name": "DNA Data Decoding", "pure_software": true, "file_ids": ["Literature-dee0"]}, "id": "266e6671-9882-4222-a694-1dc6f7a03e0a", "type": "tool_call"}]}
