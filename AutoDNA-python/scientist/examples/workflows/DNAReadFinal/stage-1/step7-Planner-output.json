{"content": "I have tried to generate a protocol for you, but it seems that almost all the reagents required for the previously generated protocol are not available in the lab. This makes it impossible to proceed with the experiment as planned.\n\nTo overcome this, I will now take a different approach. I will first check all the available reagents in the lab's inventory. This will give me a complete picture of the resources I have to work with. Once I have this information, I will attempt to generate a new experimental protocol that is specifically designed to work with the reagents that are actually available. This way, I can ensure that the new protocol is feasible and can be executed successfully.\n\nI am choosing the Reagent agent for this purpose. I will set the `gather_mode` parameter to `True`, which instructs the agent to return a summary of all reagents in the lab's inventory. I am leaving the `reagent_query_id` parameter empty because I am not checking for specific reagents, but rather gathering a list of all available ones.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Reagent", "args": {"gather_mode": true}, "id": "07555ed2-3392-417e-a0e6-d542ab7b08d4", "type": "tool_call"}]}
