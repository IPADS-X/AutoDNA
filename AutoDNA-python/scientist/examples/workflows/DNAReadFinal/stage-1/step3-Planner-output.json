{"content": "I have identified a suitable protocol for your experiment. The Sanger method, specifically the thermal cycle sequencing with fluorescent dye-labeled terminators, is a well-established and reliable choice for DNA sequencing. I will now generate a detailed experimental procedure based on this method.\n\nI will use the `Protocol` agent to generate the procedure. Here's my reasoning for the parameters I've chosen:\n\n- `experiment_name`: I've set this to \"DNA Sequencing\" to reflect the goal of the current stage.\n- `file_ids`: I'm providing the file ID of the literature search result (`Literature-cfb5`). This file contains a wealth of information about various DNA sequencing protocols, and the `Protocol` agent will use this information to construct a detailed and accurate procedure. I am not including any other parameters as they are not relevant at this stage.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"experiment_name": "DNA Sequencing", "file_ids": ["Literature-cfb5"]}, "id": "24d6245a-8a40-4ad8-9004-c3246d8d3af5", "type": "tool_call"}]}
