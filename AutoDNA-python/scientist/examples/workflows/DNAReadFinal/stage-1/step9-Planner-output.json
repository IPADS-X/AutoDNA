{"content": "I have previously conducted a literature search to understand the various methods for DNA sequencing, which led to the creation of a comprehensive protocol outlining multiple sequencing techniques. However, a subsequent check of the lab's inventory revealed that the majority of the reagents required for the initial protocol are unavailable. To address this, I performed another inventory check, this time gathering a complete list of all available reagents. This new list indicates that the lab is equipped for MinION sequencing.\n\nTherefore, my next step is to generate a new, feasible protocol that is specifically tailored to the available reagents. I will use the Protocol agent to create a procedure for DNA sequencing using the MinION device. This involves providing the agent with the experiment name, the list of available reagents and manuals, and setting the `retry` parameter to `True` to signal a shift in strategy due to the previous protocol's failure.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"experiment_name": "MinION sequencing", "manuals": ["MinION-manual"], "retry": true, "file_ids": ["Reagent-68a6"]}, "id": "2725b620-cc2e-48de-9c56-fd6ee12199e9", "type": "tool_call"}]}
