{"content": "I have chosen the `Hardware` agent to execute the generated code for the MinION sequencing protocol.\n\nHere is my reasoning for selecting this agent and its parameters:\n- **Agent Choice**: The `Hardware` agent is the only one capable of executing the Python code that controls the laboratory robot and the MinION sequencing device.\n- **`file_ids`**: I am providing the file ID `Code-5b91`, which was the output of the `Code` agent in the previous step. This file contains the executable Python script for the entire sequencing workflow.\n- **`repeat_num`**: I have set this to `1` because a single, complete sequencing run is required to analyze the prepared DNA library. There is no instruction or scientific reason to repeat the entire sequencing process at this stage.\n- **`pure_software`**: I am leaving this parameter empty because the experiment involves physical hardware (the MinION sequencer and liquid handling robots) and is not a purely computational task.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Hardware", "args": {"repeat_num": 1.0, "file_ids": ["Code-5b91"]}, "id": "0e1d486d-f623-4948-bab8-2e652cb305cc", "type": "tool_call"}]}
