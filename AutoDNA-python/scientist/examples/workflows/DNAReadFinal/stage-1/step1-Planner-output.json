{"content": "I will call the `Literature` agent to search for information about the DNA sequencing protocol.\nThe `Literature` agent is a tool that can search the local database of scientific papers for answers to specific questions. I will use it to find a suitable protocol for DNA sequencing, which is the goal of the current stage.\n\nI will fill in the `questions` parameter with \"What is the protocol for DNA sequencing?\". I am asking this question to get a general protocol for DNA sequencing. This will give me a good starting point for generating a detailed experimental procedure.\n\nI will fill in the `experiment_name` parameter with \"DNA Sequencing\". This will help the agent to narrow down the search to the relevant experiment.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Literature", "args": {"experiment_name": "DNA Sequencing", "questions": ["What is the protocol for DNA sequencing?"]}, "id": "4717e437-ba73-4357-b422-765b1f2da5df", "type": "tool_call"}]}
