The polymerase synthesizes a new chain starting at the 3\u2032 end of a primer DNA complementary to a single-stranded \"template\" DNA strand (Shendure2011 pages 1-2). Dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) are incorporated, which lack the 3\u2032-hydroxyl group necessary for further chain elongation, thereby terminating DNA synthesis (Franc2002 pages 3-7; Van2008 pages 13-16).\n\n**Original Chain-Termination Method (Sanger et al. 1977):**\n1.  A $^{32}$P-labelled primer (short oligonucleotide complementary to the template DNA) is annealed to a specific known region on the template DNA (Franc2002 pages 3-7).\n2.  Catalytic polymerization of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) onto the DNA occurs in the presence of DNA polymerases (Franc2002 pages 3-7).\n3.  Polymerization extends until a modified nucleoside, a terminator or ddNTP, is incorporated (Franc2002 pages 3-7).\n4.  The reaction is performed in four different tubes, each containing the appropriate amount of one of the four terminators (Franc2002 pages 3-7).\n5.  All generated fragments have the same 5\u2032-end, with the residue at the 3\u2032-end determined by the dideoxynucleotide used in the reaction (Franc2002 pages 3-7).\n6.  After all four reactions are completed, the mixture of different-sized DNA fragments is resolved by electrophoresis on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, in four parallel lanes (Franc2002 pages 3-7; Murray1996 pages 4-4).\n7.  The unknown sequence is read by autoradiography (Franc2002 pages 3-7).\n\n**Thermal Cycle Sequencing (Cycle Sequencing):**\nThis protocol was developed to sequence double-stranded DNA templates without the need for independent pre-denaturation steps (Shendure2011 pages 1-2).\n1.  A standard PCR thermocycling machine and a sequencing reaction-specific thermocycling program are used (Van2008 pages 13-16).\n2.  Both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA template may be used, as the temperature achieved during thermocycling is sufficient to thermally dissociate any double-stranded DNA into single strands (Van2008 pages 13-16).\n3.  Cycle sequencing protocols utilize four standard PCR mixes, with each additionally containing one of four labelled chain terminating dideoxynucleotides (either ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP or ddTTP) (Van2008 pages 13-16).\n4.  Only a single (sequencing) primer is added to the sequencing reaction mix, resulting in linear amplification (Van2008 pages 16-20).\n5.  The terminated fragments in each of the four sequencing reactions are then separated by electrophoresis in a single polyacrylamide gel (Van2008 pages 16-20).\n6.  The labelled fragments are detected using, for example, radioactive sensitive film (e.g., Hyperfilm, Amersham International) (Van2008 pages 16-20).\n\n**Optimized Fast Cycling Protocol (STeP):**\nThis protocol aims to increase throughput and improve data quality (Platt2007 pages 2-3).\n1.  An initial 60 s incubation at 96\u00b0C (Platt2007 pages 3-4).\n2.  Followed by 25 cycles of: 96\u00b0C for 10 s; 50\u00b0C for 5 s; and 60\u00b0C for 75 s (Platt2007 pages 3-4).\n3.  In STeP, the duration of Te (elongation time) is extended by 15 s for cycles 16\u201320 and an additional 30 s for cycles 21\u201325 (Platt2007 pages 3-4).\n4.  No changes are made to the denaturation or annealing temperatures or times (Platt2007 pages 3-4).\n5.  The reaction components are: 0.5 \u03bcL BigDye Terminator v3.1, 2.0 \u03bcL 5\u00d7 Sequencing Buffer, 2.0 \u03bcL (20 ng) Primer, 2.0 \u03bcL (200 ng) DNA, 3.5 \u03bcL Deionized Water, for a Total Volume of 10 \u03bcL, with a Cycling Time of 55 min (Platt2007 pages 2-3).\n\n**Sample Preparation:**\nGeneral steps include (i) DNA scission and cloning into a vector (e.g., M13 or M13mp18); (ii) vector amplification to produce a phage-infected culture; and (iii) purification from the cell culture to yield pure single-stranded (ss)DNA template (Franc2002 pages 7-10).\n*   **Random Fragmentation:** Genomic DNA is randomly fragmented (e.g., by sonication or nebulization) into smaller pieces, typically 2 to 3 kb, which are then inserted into a vector and replicated in bacterial culture (Franc2002 pages 3-7).\n*   **Purification:** Methods include using exonuclease I and shrimp alkaline phosphatase to degrade excess primers and non-incorporated nucleotides, precipitation by isopropyl alcohol, or plasmid-based amplification in *E. coli* followed by alkaline lysis (Birnboim & Doly, 1979) (Franc2002 pages 7-10).\n*   **Generating Single-Stranded DNA:**\n    *   Heating double-stranded DNA at 100\u00b0C for 5 minutes, followed by \"snap-cooling\" in ice, a dry-ice/ethanol bath, or liquid nitrogen (Van2008 pages 13-16).\n    *   Alkaline denaturation (Van2008 pages 13-16).\n    *   Using 5\u2032-end hapten-labelled (e.g., biotin) PCR primers to attach double-stranded PCR products to a solid phase (e.g., streptavidin-coated ELISA plate wells or magnetic beads), followed by removal of the complementary DNA strand (e.g., by alkaline treatment) (Van2008 pages 13-16).\n    *   Asymmetric PCR, where one PCR primer is present in a higher concentration (usually 1:50 to 1:100 higher) than the other, generating high concentrations of single-stranded DNA molecules up to 1,000 bp in length (Van2008 pages 11-13, 13-16).\n    *   Lambda exonuclease III, a 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease specific for double-stranded DNA requiring a phosphate group at the 5\u2032-end. The procedure involves 5\u2032-end labelling of double-stranded PCR products using T4 polynucleotide kinase and ATP (or a 5\u2032-end phosphorylated primer), followed by exonuclease degradation of the phosphorylated DNA strand (Van2008 pages 13-16).\n\n**Enzyme Technology:**\nInitially, isothermal DNA polymerases (e.g., T4 or T7 DNA polymerases) were used at physiological temperatures (approx. 37\u00b0C) for approximately 20 minutes (Franc2002 pages 3-7). The discovery of heat-stable DNA polymerase from *Thermus aquaticus* (Taq polymerase) enabled cycle-sequencing with reduced DNA template amounts (Franc2002 pages 3-7). Modified Taq polymerase with equalized ddNTP incorporation rates improved sequencing performance (Franc2002 pages 7-10). PCR enzymes require 3\u2032- to 5\u2032-exonuclease activity (proof-reading), which must be suppressed for cycle-sequencing to avoid un-interpretable data (Franc2002 pages 7-10). Newer, specifically engineered, thermostable DNA polymerases (e.g., Thermosequenase, Sequencing Grade Taq DNA Polymerase, Amplitaq DNA polymerase FS) show improved affinity for ddNTPs, uniform band intensities, and high accuracy (Van2008 pages 16-20).\n\n**Labels and DNA Labelling:**\n*   **Radioisotopes:** $^{32}$P was initially used (Franc2002 pages 7-10). Deoxyadenosine 5\u2032-(\u03b1-[$^{35}$S]thio)triphosphate ($^{35}$S) increased band sharpness and resolution (Franc2002 pages 7-10). [\u03b1-$^{33}$P]dATP provides short exposure times similar to $^{32}$P but band resolution comparable to $^{35}$S (Shendure2011 pages 3-4).\n*   **Chemiluminescent Detection:** The biotin\u2013streptavidin system uses a 5\u2032-end biotin-linked oligonucleotide as a primer. Alkaline phosphatase, bound to the 5\u2032-end via a streptavidin conjugate, catalyzes a luminescent reaction detected by photographic film (Franc2002 pages 7-10).\n*   **Fluorescent Dyes:**\n    *   **Four-Dye, Single-Lane Separation:** Smith et al. (1986) developed a set of four different fluorescent dyes (fluorescein, 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-1-diazole (NBD), tetramethyl-rhodamine, and Texas Red) (Franc2002 pages 10-12). Each dye is attached to the 5\u2032-end of the primer and associated with a particular ddNTP (e.g., fluorescein-labelled primer with ddCTP, tetramethyl-rhodamine-labelled primer with ddATP). All four reactions are combined and introduced onto a slab gel in a single lane. Bands are detected by laser excitation at the end of the gel, and fluorescent light is separated by four different colored filters (Franc2002 pages 10-12).\n    *   **Dye-labelled Primer Chemistry:** Fluorescent labels are attached at the 5\u2032-end of the primer, requiring four separate reactions (Franc2002 pages 10-12).\n    *   **Dye-labelled Terminator Chemistry:** The fluorescent moiety is linked to the ddNTP terminators, allowing the synthesis of all four ladders in a single vial (Franc2002 pages 10-12; Van2008 pages 16-20).\n    *   **Alternative Dyes:** Tetramethyl-rhodamine (\u03bbexc \u2248 560 nm, \u03bbem \u2248 575 nm, FWHM \u2248 52 nm), fluorescein iodoacetamine, carboxyfluorescein (FAM), carboxy-4\u2032,5\u2032-dichloro-2\u2032,7\u2032-dimethoxyfluorescein (JOE), carboxytetramethyl-rhodamine (TAMRA), and carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX) are commonly used. FAM and JOE require 488 nm excitation, while TAMRA and ROX require 543 nm (Franc2002 pages 10-12). Base-specific succinylfluorescein dyes (SF-xxx) and dipyrrometheneborondifluoride fluorophores (BODIPY) are also utilized (Franc2002 pages 10-12).\n    *   **Energy Transfer (ET) Dyes:** Consist of two dyes per primer: a common donor (e.g., fluorescein (FAM) or cyanine (Cy5) derivative) at the 5\u2032-end and an acceptor dye (e.g., FAM, JOE, TAMRA, ROX) located approximately 10 bases along the primer. These dyes can be almost evenly excited by a single wavelength (488 nm) and exhibit minimal electrophoretic mobility shifts (Franc2002 pages 10-12).\n    *   **One-Tube Cycle Sequencing:** Uses non-radioactive, fluorescent-based dye labels chemically attached to dideoxynucleotidetriphosphates, each fluorescing with specific spectral characteristics (e.g., FAM, HEX, TAMRA, ROX) (Van2008 pages 16-20). All four tagged ddNTPs are added to a single cycle sequencing reaction mix. After thermocycling, the terminated DNA fragments are separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, excited by a static laser, and the fluorescence is measured (Van2008 pages 16-20).\n\n**Fragment Separation and Analysis:**\n*   **Electrophoresis:** Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is a standard method (Franc2002 pages 3-7). Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) using polymer solutions is 8\u201310 times faster per lane than slab gels, and Capillary Array Electrophoresis (CAE) instruments can run 96 samples simultaneously (Franc2002 pages 14-16).\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   **Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization\u2013time of flight (MALDI\u2013TOF) MS:** The sample is co-crystallized with an energy-absorbing compound (e.g., aromatic amine or carboxylic acid). A laser pulse at the matrix's absorption maximum vaporizes the matrix, expelling and ionizing sample molecules via proton-exchange reactions. Ions are then accelerated and separated by their mass-to-charge ratio in a drift tube (Franc2002 pages 14-16).\n    *   **Electrospray ionization (ESI) MS:** Used for detecting short oligomers by negative ion mode MS (Franc2002 pages 14-16).\n\n### Maxam & Gilbert and Other Chemical Methods\n\nThis method involves subjecting end-labelled DNA fragments to random cleavage at adenine, cytosine, guanine, or thymine positions using specific chemical agents (Franc2002 pages 14-16). The chemical attack proceeds in three steps: base modification, removal of the modified base from its sugar, and DNA strand breaking at that sugar position (Franc2002 pages 14-16).\n\n**Template:** Double-stranded (ds)DNA or ssDNA from chromosomal DNA can be used. Fragments are generally digested with an appropriate restriction enzyme (Maxam & Gilbert, 1980) (Franc2002 pages 14-16).\n\n**End-Labelling:**\n*   Originally performed with [$^{32}$P]phosphate or a nucleotide linked to $^{32}$P and enzymically incorporated into the end fragment (Franc2002 pages 14-16).\n*   Alternatively, restriction fragments are labelled through [$^{35}$S]dideoxyadenosine 5\u2032-(\u03b1-thio)triphosphate ([$^{35}$S]ddATP\u03b1S) and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Franc2002 pages 14-16).\n*   Non-radioactive labelling includes a 21-mer fluorescein-labelled M13 sequencing primer (Franc2002 pages 14-16).\n*   A biotin marker molecule can be chemically or enzymically attached to an oligonucleotide primer or enzymically attached to an end-filling reaction of restriction enzyme sites (Franc2002 pages 16-18).\n*   PCR can be used to amplify products where one of the primers is end-labelled (Franc2002 pages 16-18).\n\n**Chemical Cleavage Reactions:**\n*   **Four-lane methods:** Four (or more) separate cleavage procedures are used, with information displayed in four (or more) parallel gel lanes (Franc2002 pages 18-20).\n    *   **G+A:** Dimethyl sulphate (DMS) followed by heating at pH 7/0.1 M alkali at 90 \u00b0C (Franc2002 pages 16-18).\n    *   **A+G:** DMS-acid/alkali (Franc2002 pages 16-18).\n    *   **C+T:** Hydrazine at 20 \u00b0C (Franc2002 pages 16-18).\n    *   **C:** Hydrazine-2 M NaCl (Franc2002 pages 16-18).\n    *   Almost all base-specific reactions are followed by treatment with hot aqueous piperidine (Franc2002 pages 16-18).\n*   **One-lane (or two-lane) methods:** All reactions are based on only one chemical modification, and electrophoresis is performed in a single (or two) lane(s) (Franc2002 pages 18-20).\n    *   The first single-lane method used hot aqueous piperidine for several hours (Ambrose & Pless, 1985) (Franc2002 pages 18-20).\n    *   A two-lane method involves heating the labelled DNA fragment in the presence of formamide, resulting in efficient cleavage of the phosphodiester bond at 3\u2032 residues A, C, and G, with relative efficiency A \u2248 G > C. The bias between A and G is obtained through a pretreatment consisting of a photoreaction with Methylene Blue (Negri et al. 1991) (Franc2002 pages 18-20).\n    *   Another single-lane method determines the DNA sequence by monitoring the intensities of bands representing cleavage products at the four bases, obtained by solvolysis in hot aqueous piperidine (10%) followed by treatment with hot formamide (Ferraboli et al. 1993) (Franc2002 pages 18-20). Guanine sensitivity can be increased by using inosine instead of guanosine residues, and adenine sensitivity decreased by substituting them with their diazo derivatives (Saladino et al. 1996) (Franc2002 pages 18-20). N-methylformamide in the presence of manganese has also yielded satisfactory results (Negri et al. 1996) (Franc2002 pages 18-20).\n\n**Fragment Separation and Detection:**\nProducts of these reactions are separated using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Franc2002 pages 14-16). Chemiluminescent detection involves transferring the chemically cleaved DNA fragment from a sequencing gel onto a nylon membrane. Specific sequences are then selected by hybridization to DNA oligonucleotides labelled with alkaline phosphatase or biotin. The membrane is soaked in the chemiluminescent substrate (AMPPD) and exposed to photographic film (Franc2002 pages 16-18). MALDI\u2013TOF MS has also been used to separate the products of Maxam\u2013Gilbert reactions (Isola et al. 1999) (Franc2002 pages 16-18).\n\n**Automation and Solid-Phase Techniques:**\n*   A computer-controlled microchemical robot can carry out one of the four reactions (G, A+C, C+T, or C) in less than 2 hours (Wada et al. 1983; Wada, 1984) (Franc2002 pages 16-18).\n*   DNA can be immobilized by adsorption to DEAE paper (Whatman DE 81 paper) (Chuvpilo & Kravchenko, 1984) (Franc2002 pages 16-18).\n*   A new carrier medium, CCS anion-exchange paper (Whatman 540 paper activated with cyanuric chloride and then reacted with 2-bromo-ethylamine hydrobromide), provides excellent stability (Rosenthal et al. 1985, 1986; Rosenthal, 1987) (Franc2002 pages 16-18).\n*   Reverse-phase chromatography (C18-filled mini-columns) works for both short and long DNA fragments (Jagadeeswaran & Kaul, 1986) (Franc2002 pages 16-18).\n*   DNA immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads has been used (Ohara & Ohara, 1995). An improvement involved a PCR-primer linked to biotin and fluorescein at the 5\u2032-end, replacing the piperidine evaporation step with a magnetic-capture washing cycle (Ohara et al. 1997) (Franc2002 pages 16-18).\n\n### Pyrosequencing\n\nPyrosequencing is a real-time DNA-sequencing method based on the detection of pyrophosphate (PPi) released during the DNA polymerization reaction (Nyre\u0301n & Lundin, 1985; Hyman, 1988; Ronaghi et al. 1996) (Franc2002 pages 18-20).\n\n**Enzymic Cascade:**\n1.  **DNA polymerase:** When one of the deoxynucleotides (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, or dTTP) is incorporated into the chain extension by DNA polymerase, PPi is released: (DNA)n-dNTP \u2192 (DNA)n+1-PPi (Franc2002 pages 18-20).\n2.  **ATP sulphurylase:** The liberated PPi is then converted into ATP by ATP sulphurylase: PPi + APS \u2192 ATP + SO4^2- (where APS is adenosine 5\u2032-phosphosulphate) (Franc2002 pages 18-20).\n3.  **Luciferase:** Light is emitted via firefly luciferase, which catalyzes luciferin into oxyluciferin: ATP + luciferin + O2 \u2192 AMP + PPi + oxyluciferin + CO2 + h\u03bd (where h\u03bd represents a photon) (Franc2002 pages 18-20).\n\n**Sequence Determination:** The sequence is determined by noting if incorporations occur and by counting the number of incorporations (by measuring the light intensity). The amount of light emitted can be measured by an avalanche photodiode, photomultiplier tube, or a charged-coupled device camera (Franc2002 pages 18-20).\n\n**Approaches:**\n*   **Solid-phase sequencing (three-enzyme mixture):** Requires a template-washing step between nucleotide additions to remove non-incorporated deoxynucleotides and ATP. The template must be bound to a solid support (e.g., a magnetic bead) (Franc2002 pages 18-20).\n*   **Liquid-phase sequencing (four-enzyme mixture):** A nucleotide-degrading enzyme (e.g., apyrase) is added to eliminate washing steps; unreacted nucleotides and ATP produced are degraded by the enzyme (Franc2002 pages 18-20).\n\n**Improvements/Modifications:**\n*   Using ssDNA-binding proteins (SSB) to displace primers that bind non-specifically to the target DNA template, minimizing non-specific signals (Ronaghi, 2000) (Franc2002 pages 18-20). This strategy increased enzyme efficiency, reduced mispriming, increased signal intensity, and yielded higher accuracy in reading the number of identical adjacent nucleotides in difficult templates (Franc2002 pages 20-23).\n*   A simplified enzymic method for template preparation makes possible the use of dsDNA (Nordstrom et al. 2000a, b) (Franc2002 pages 20-23).\n*   Replacing dATP with dATP\u03b1S in the trial step solves the interference of dATP in luminescence detection, as dATP\u03b1S is efficiently incorporated by DNA polymerase but does not function as a substrate for luciferase (Ronaghi et al. 1996) (Franc2002 pages 20-23).\n\n**Template Preparation:** ssDNA, amplified by PCR, must be used (Franc2002 pages 20-23).\n\n### Single Molecule Sequencing with Exonuclease\n\nThis laser-based technique allows fast sequencing of DNA fragments of 40 kb or more at a rate of 100\u20131000 bases per second (Jett et al. 1989) (Franc2002 pages 20-23). It is based on the detection of individual fluorescent nucleotides in a flowing sample stream (Shera et al. 1990; Harding & Keller, 1992) (Franc2002 pages 20-23).\n\n**Steps:**\n1.  **Fluorescent labelling of bases:** Every base in one strand is completely labelled, with each nucleotide type labelled with a characteristic dye possessing large fluorescence quantum yields and distinguishable spectral properties (Do\u0308rre et al. 1997) (Franc2002 pages 20-23).\n2.  **Attachment of labelled DNA fragment:** A single DNA strand (e.g., 5\u2032-biotinylated DNA) is selected and attached to a streptavidin-coated microsphere (Stephan et al. 2001) (Franc2002 pages 20-23). Only one DNA fragment must be attached to the microsphere (Davis et al. 1991; Goodwin et al. 1997) (Franc2002 pages 23-25).\n3.  **Movement of supported DNA fragment:** The microsphere with the attached DNA fragment is moved into a flowing buffer stream (Franc2002 pages 20-23).\n4.  **Digestion with exonuclease:** An exonuclease is added to the 3\u2032-end of the labelled DNA fragment in the flow stream, initiating the sequential cleavage of bases from the 3\u2032- to the 5\u2032-end of the DNA (Franc2002 pages 23-25). The rate of cleavage can be adjusted by varying the exonuclease concentration, cofactor concentration, temperature, or by using inhibitors (Davis et al. 1991) (Franc2002 pages 23-25).\n5.  **Detection and identification:** Individual fluorescently labelled bases are detected and identified as they cross a focused laser beam (Franc2002 pages 20-23).\n\n**Detection Methods:**\n*   Photon-burst detection, where photon bursts are correlated in time to distinguish them from background (Greenless et al. 1977) (Franc2002 pages 23-25).\n*   Time-correlated single-photon counting in combination with mode-locked picosecond-pulsed excitation (Wilkerson et al. 1993) (Franc2002 pages 23-25).\n*   Surface-enhanced Raman scattering for detecting single DNA base molecules (Kneipp et al. 1998) (Franc2002 pages 23-25).\n*   A confocal set-up for detection and identification of single molecules in solution (Eigen & Rigler, 1994) (Franc2002 pages 23-25).\n*   A multiplex technique for identifying single fluorescent molecules in a flowing sample stream by correlated measurement of single-molecule fluorescence burst size and intraburst fluorescence decay rate (Van Orden et al. 1998) (Franc2002 pages 23-25).\n\n**Oxford Nanopore Technology (as of 2011, not commercially available):** This method uses exonuclease I or a modified phi29 polymerase coupled to a plate in parallel spots, surrounded by a lipid bilayer incorporating MspA or alpha hemolysin with electrodes on both sides. When DNA is introduced, the exonuclease progressively cleaves the terminal nucleotide that enters the nanopore (Shendure2011 pages 16-17).\n\n**Heliscope Sequencing:**\nIn Heliscope sequencing, single-stranded fragments are applied to a flow cell with billions of oligo(dT) molecules covalently bound to the glass surface. The flow cell captures individual library fragments by hybridization of the poly(dA) tailed fragments to oligo(dT) (Shendure2011 pages 16-17). Fluorescent nucleotides are pumped in one at a time (Shendure2011 pages 16-17).\n The information has been saved to the file: Literature-cfb5", "================================== Ai Message ==================================\n\nI have identified a suitable protocol for your experiment.

Unincorporated nucleotides are washed away (solid-phase) or degraded by apyrase (liquid-phase) before the next dNTP is added.)\n\n        Option 4.2.2: Sequential addition using dATP\u03b1S.\n            - Component A: Prepared pyrosequencing reaction from Step 4.1\n            - Component B: dATP\u03b1S\n            - Component C: dCTP\n            - Component D: dGTP\n            - Component E: dTTP\n            (operational details: Perform the sequential addition as in Option 4.2.1, but substitute dATP with dATP\u03b1S. dATP\u03b1S is incorporated by DNA polymerase but is not a substrate for luciferase, thus preventing false signals from residual dATP interfering with the light detection reaction.)\n\nPart 5: Single Molecule Sequencing with Exonuclease\n\n    Step 5.1: Prepare and immobilize a single labeled DNA molecule.\n\n        Option 5.1.1: Complete fluorescent labeling and immobilization.\n            - Component A: dsDNA fragment\n            - Component B: Fluorescently labeled nucleotides (each of the four bases labeled with a distinct dye)\n            - Component C: 5\u2032-biotinylated DNA strand\n            - Component D: streptavidin-coated microsphere\n            (operational details: Synthesize or label one strand of a DNA fragment such that every base is fluorescently labeled. Ensure the labeled strand has a 5'-biotin tag. Attach a single labeled DNA molecule to a single streptavidin-coated microsphere.)\n\n    Step 5.2: Perform exonuclease digestion and detection.\n\n        Option 5.2.1: Flow-based cleavage and detection.\n            - Component A: Microsphere with attached single DNA molecule\n            - Component B: flowing buffer stream\n            - Component C: exonuclease\n            (operational details: Suspend the microsphere in a flowing buffer stream. Introduce an exonuclease, which binds to the 3'-end of the DNA and sequentially cleaves the labeled nucleotide monophosphates. As each labeled base is cleaved, it is carried by the flow stream through a focused laser beam for detection and identification based on its unique fluorescence.)\n\n---\nA list containing reagents whose availability has yet to be verified.\nReagent Check List:\n---\n[S]ddATP\u03b1S\n[$^{32}$P]phosphate\n[$^{33}$P]dATP\n[$^{35}$S]\n5\u00d7 Sequencing Buffer\nAdenosine 5\u2032-phosphosulphate (APS)\nalkaline solution\nAlkaline phosphatase\nAMPPD\nAmplitaq DNA polymerase FS\napyrase\naromatic amine\naromatic carboxylic acid\nATP\nATP sulphurylase\nBigDye Terminator v3.1\nbiotin\nbiotin marker\nbiotinylated DNA strand\ncarboxy-4\u2032,5\u2032-dichloro-2\u2032,7\u2032-dimethoxyfluorescein (JOE)\ncarboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX)\ncarboxyfluorescein (FAM)\ncarboxytetramethyl-rhodamine (TAMRA)\nChemiluminescent substrate\ndATP\ndATP\u03b1S\ndCTP\nDeionized Water\nDenaturing polyacrylamide gel\ndGTP\nDimethyl sulphate (DMS)\nDNA\nDNA oligonucleotides labelled with alkaline phosphatase or biotin\nDNA polymerase\ndNTPs\ndTTP\ndry-ice/ethanol bath\nexonuclease\nexonuclease I\nfluorescein\nfluorescein-labelled M13 sequencing primer\nformamide\nForward PCR primer\nGenomic DNA\nHydrazine\nHyperfilm\nisopropyl alcohol\nLambda exonuclease III\nliquid nitrogen\nluciferase\nluciferin\nMethylene Blue\nN-methylformamide\nNaCl\nNylon membrane\nPCR Buffer\nPhotographic film\npiperidine\nPolymer solution for CE\nPrimer\nPurified ssDNA template\nradioactive sensitive film\nReverse PCR primer\nsalt solution\nSequencing Grade Taq DNA Polymerase\nsequencing primer\nshrimp alkaline phosphatase\nssDNA-binding proteins (SSB)\nstreptavidin conjugate\nstreptavidin-coated ELISA plate wells\nstreptavidin-coated magnetic beads\nstreptavidin-coated microsphere\nT4 DNA polymerase\nT4 polynucleotide kinase\nT7 DNA polymerase\nTaq polymerase\nterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase\nThermosequenase\nthermostable DNA polymerase\ntetramethyl-rhodamine\n The procedure has been saved to the file: Protocol-40e6", "================================== Ai Message ==================================\n\nI have chosen the `Reagent` agent to move forward.\n\nMy reasoning for choosing this agent is as follows:\nI have already generated a comprehensive experimental protocol for DNA sequencing, which is stored in the file with ID `Protocol-40e6`. This protocol lists a wide variety of reagents required for different sequencing methods. Before proceeding to the next step of generating code or executing the experiment, it is crucial to determine which of these reagents are actually available in the laboratory. This will allow me to filter the protocol down to a feasible workflow.\n\nThe `Reagent` agent is the only tool available for checking the lab's inventory. Therefore, it is the next logical step in the workflow.\n\nMy reasoning for filling in the parameters is as follows:\n- `reagent_query_id`: I am providing the file ID `Protocol-40e6` which contains the list of all the reagents I want to check. The agent will parse this file and check the availability of each reagent.\n- `gather_mode`: I am leaving this parameter empty (defaulting to `False`) because I am not interested in a summary of all reagents in the inventory. Instead, I want to check the availability of a specific list of reagents that are relevant to my current task of DNA sequencing.\nTool Calls:\n  Reagent (c8ab74d8-0d4b-4a75-884f-49e97b242c42)\n Call ID: c8ab74d8-0d4b-4a75-884f-49e97b242c42\n  Args:\n    reagent_query_id: Protocol-40e6", "================================= Tool Message =================================\nName: Reagent\n\nddATP\u03b1S: not available\n[$^{32}$P]phosphate: not available\n[$^{33}$P]dATP: not available\n[$^{35}$S]: not available\n5\u00d7 Sequencing Buffer: not available, Sequencing Buffer (concentration not specified) is available\nAdenosine 5\u2032-phosphosulphate (APS): not available\nalkaline solution: not available\nAlkaline phosphatase: not available\nAMPPD: not available\nAmplitaq DNA polymerase FS: not available\napyrase: not available\naromatic amine: not available\naromatic carboxylic acid: not available\nATP: not available\nATP sulphurylase: not available\nBigDye Terminator v3.1: not available\nbiotin: not available\nbiotin marker: not available\nbiotinylated DNA strand: not available\ncarboxy-4\u2032,5\u2032-dichloro-2\u2032,7\u2032-dimethoxyfluorescein (JOE): not available\ncarboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX): not available\ncarboxyfluorescein (FAM): not available\ncarboxytetramethyl-rhodamine (TAMRA): not available\nChemiluminescent substrate: not available\ndATP: not available\ndATP\u03b1S: not available\ndCTP: not available\nDeionized Water: available\nDenaturing polyacrylamide gel: not available\ndGTP: not available\nDimethyl sulphate (DMS): not available\nDNA: available\nDNA oligonucleotides labelled with alkaline phosphatase or biotin: not available\nDNA polymerase: not available\ndNTPs: not available\ndTTP: not available\ndry-ice/ethanol bath: not available\nexonuclease: not available\nexonuclease I: not available\nfluorescein: not available\nfluorescein-labelled M13 sequencing primer: not available\nformamide: not available\nForward PCR primer: not available\nGenomic DNA: available\nHydrazine: not available\nHyperfilm: not available\nisopropyl alcohol: not available\nLambda exonuclease III: not available\nliquid nitrogen: not available\nluciferase: not available\nluciferin: not available\nMethylene Blue: not available\nN-methylformamide: not available\nNaCl: not available\nNylon membrane: not available\nPCR Buffer: not available\nPhotographic film: not available\npiperidine: not available\nPolymer solution for CE: not available\nPrimer: not available\nPurified ssDNA template: available\nradioactive sensitive film: not available\nReverse PCR primer: not available\nsalt solution: not available\nSequencing Grade Taq DNA Polymerase: not available\nsequencing primer: not available\nshrimp alkaline phosphatase: not available\nssDNA-binding proteins (SSB): not available\nstreptavidin conjugate: not available\nstreptavidin-coated ELISA plate wells: not available\nstreptavidin-coated magnetic beads: not available\nstreptavidin-coated microsphere: not available\nT4 DNA polymerase: not available\nT4 polynucleotide kinase: not available\nT7 DNA polymerase: not available\nTaq polymerase: not available\nterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase: not available\nThermosequenase: not available\nthermostable DNA polymerase: not available\ntetramethyl-rhodamine: not available\n The information about requested reagents has been saved to the file: Reagent-d690"]}
