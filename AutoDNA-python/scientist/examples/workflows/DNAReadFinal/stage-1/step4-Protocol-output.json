One sample is subjected to a photoreaction with Methylene Blue. Both samples are then heated in the presence of formamide, which cleaves the phosphodiester bond at A, C, and G residues. The pretreatment creates a bias between A and G cleavage, allowing for differentiation across two lanes.)\n\n        Option 3.2.3: One-lane solvolysis cleavage.\n            - Component A: End-labeled DNA\n            - Component B: aqueous piperidine (10%)\n            - Component C: formamide\n            (operational details: Perform solvolysis by treating the sample with hot aqueous piperidine followed by hot formamide.

Prepare a reaction mixture containing the three enzymes, APS, and luciferin. This system requires washing steps between nucleotide additions.)\n\n        Option 4.1.2: Liquid-phase (four-enzyme) system.\n            - Component A: ssDNA template in solution\n            - Component B: sequencing primer\n            - Component C: DNA polymerase\n            - Component D: ATP sulphurylase\n            - Component E: Luciferase\n            - Component F: apyrase\n            - Component G: Adenosine 5\u2032-phosphosulphate (APS)\n            - Component H: luciferin\n            (operational details: Anneal the primer to the template in solution.
