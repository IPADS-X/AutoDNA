This will provide the foundational information needed to generate a specific experimental procedure. I will then use this information to create a detailed protocol, check for the availability of the necessary reagents, and finally generate and execute the code for the purification process. The experiment name will be \"DNA template removal and siRNA clean-up\", and the question for the literature search will be \"How to remove DNA template and clean up siRNA from in vitro transcription reaction?\". This will ensure that the subsequent steps are based on established scientific methods.\nTool Calls:\n  Literature (4e3de0f9-b5b3-4935-8317-28745dde14a4)\n Call ID: 4e3de0f9-b5b3-4935-8317-28745dde14a4\n  Args:\n    experiment_name: DNA template removal and siRNA clean-up\n    questions: ['How to remove DNA template and clean up siRNA from in vitro transcription reaction?']", "================================= Tool Message =================================\nName: Literature\n\nTo remove DNA templates and purify siRNA from an in vitro transcription reaction, several methods are available.\n\n### DNA Template Removal\n\n1.  **Nuclease Treatment for siRNA Synthesis**\n    Following the in vitro transcription reaction, add the following reagents to the reaction tube:\n    *   RNase-free DNase I (5 U/\u00b5l): 2 \u00b5l (In2021 pages 8-14)\n    *   RNase T1 (4 U/\u00b5l): 1 \u00b5l (In2021 pages 8-14)\n        *   Note: The 4 U/\u00b5l RNase T1 is prepared by diluting the kit's RNase T1 with RNase T1 Dilution Buffer and should be used as soon as possible without storage (In2021 pages 8-14).\n    Incubate the mixture at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours (In2021 pages 8-14).\n\n2.  **General DNase I Treatment**\n    After the transcription reaction, add 10-20 U/20 \u00b5l of RNase-free DNase I, mix well, and incubate at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes (In2021 pages 1-5, In2021 pages 5-8).\n\n3.  **DNase I Treatment (Zymo Research RNA Clean & Concentrator\u2122 MagBead)**\n    This treatment is performed prior to RNA clean-up (Zymo2023 pages 7-11). For each sample, prepare a 50 \u00b5l DNase I Reaction Mix in an RNase-free tube:\n    *   RNA sample (\u2264 10 \u00b5g; volume adjusted with water or TE buffer): 40 \u00b5l (Zymo2023 pages 7-11)\n    *   DNase I (reconstituted; 1 U/\u00b5l): 5 \u00b5l (Zymo2023 pages 7-11)\n    *   DNA Digestion Buffer: 5 \u00b5l (Zymo2023 pages 7-11)\n    Mix the components by gentle inversion and incubate at room temperature (20-30\u00b0C) for 15 minutes (Zymo2023 pages 7-11). The lyophilized DNase I (250 U) is reconstituted with 275 \u00b5l of DNase/RNase-Free Water (Zymo2023 pages 1-7).\n\n### siRNA Clean-up\n\n1.  **Phenol/Chloroform Extraction and Ammonium Acetate/Ethanol Precipitation (Specific for siRNA)**\n    *   Add an equal volume of water-saturated acidic phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) to the reaction solution and mix thoroughly (In2021 pages 8-14).\n    *   Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature (In2021 pages 8-14).\n    *   Transfer the upper (aqueous) layer to a new centrifuge tube (In2021 pages 8-14).\n    *   Add an equal volume of 5 M ammonium acetate (pH 5.6) and four times the volume of 99.5% ethanol, then mix thoroughly (In2021 pages 8-14).\n    *   Let stand at room temperature for 5 minutes (In2021 pages 8-14).\n    *   Centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes (In2021 pages 8-14).\n    *   Remove the supernatant (In2021 pages 8-14).\n    *   Add 100 \u00b5l of 80% ethanol and centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 5 minutes (In2021 pages 8-14).\n    *   Remove the supernatant, dry the precipitate slightly, and dissolve it in 20-50 \u00b5l of RNase-free dH2O (In2021 pages 8-14).\n\n2.  **Commercial Columns**\n    If the phenol/chloroform method is insufficient for NTP removal or if the reaction system is scaled up, CHROMA SPIN\u2122 +TE-30 columns (Code No. 636069) are recommended (In2021 pages 8-14).\n\n3.  **Magnetic Bead-Based Clean-up (Zymo Research RNA Clean & Concentrator\u2122 MagBead)**\n    This kit is designed for high-throughput, magnetic-bead based clean-up of total RNA, including small/microRNAs (\u2265 17 nt), from in vitro transcription products (Zymo2023 pages 1-7).\n    *   **Buffer Preparation:** Reconstitute lyophilized DNase I (250 U) with 275 \u00b5l of DNase/RNase-Free Water (Zymo2023 pages 1-7).\n    *   **Total RNA Clean-up Protocol:**\n        1.  Add 150 \u00b5l of RNA MagBinding Buffer (3 volumes) to a 50 \u00b5l sample and mix well (Zymo2023 pages 1-7).\n        2.  Add 15 \u00b5l MagBinding Beads and mix well, ensuring beads are in suspension (Zymo2023 pages 1-7).\n        3.  Add 250 \u00b5l of 100% isopropanol (1.25 volumes) and mix well for 15 minutes (Zymo2023 pages 1-7).\n        4.  Transfer the plate/tube to a magnetic stand until beads pellet, then aspirate and discard the cleared supernatant (Zymo2023 pages 1-7).\n        5.  Add 500 \u00b5l of RNA Prep Buffer and mix well. Pellet the beads and discard the supernatant (Zymo2023 pages 1-7).\n        6.  Add 500 \u00b5l of ethanol (95-100%) and mix well. Pellet the beads and discard the supernatant (Zymo2023 pages 1-7).\n        7.  Add 500 \u00b5l of ethanol (95-100%) and mix well (Zymo2023 pages 1-7).\n        8.  Transfer the sample (beads and liquid) to a new plate/tube. Pellet the beads and discard the supernatant (Zymo2023 pages 1-7).\n        9.  Dry the beads at room temperature for 10 minutes or until dry (Zymo2023 pages 1-7).\n        10. To elute, add 15 \u00b5l DNase/RNase-Free Water and mix well for 5 minutes (Zymo2023 pages 1-7).\n        11. Transfer the plate/tube to the magnetic stand until beads pellet, then aspirate and dispense the eluted RNA to a new plate/tube (Zymo2023 pages 1-7).\n The information has been saved to the file: Literature-996a"]}
