To a 50 \u00b5l sample (e.g., from Option 1.1.1), add 150 \u00b5l of RNA MagBinding Buffer and mix well.\n                2. Add 15 \u00b5l of MagBinding Beads (ensure beads are fully resuspended before use) and mix well.\n                3. Add 250 \u00b5l of 100% isopropanol and mix well for 15 minutes.\n                4. Place the tube on a magnetic stand until the beads form a pellet, then aspirate and discard the cleared supernatant.\n                5. Remove from the magnetic stand, add 500 \u00b5l of RNA Prep Buffer, and mix well.\n                6. Return the tube to the magnetic stand, wait for the beads to pellet, and discard the supernatant.\n                7. Remove from the magnetic stand, add 500 \u00b5l of ethanol (95-100%), and mix well.\n                8. Return the tube to the magnetic stand, wait for the beads to pellet, and discard the supernatant.\n                9. Repeat the ethanol wash: Add another 500 \u00b5l of ethanol (95-100%) and mix well.\n                10. With the mixture in the tube, transfer the entire sample (beads and ethanol) to a new RNase-free tube.\n                11. Place the new tube on the magnetic stand, wait for the beads to pellet, and discard the supernatant.\n                12. Air-dry the beads at room temperature for approximately 10 minutes, or until fully dry.\n                13. To elute the RNA, remove the tube from the stand, add 15 \u00b5l of DNase/RNase-Free Water, and mix well for 5 minutes.\n                14. Return the tube to the magnetic stand, wait for the beads to pellet completely, then aspirate the cleared, eluted RNA and dispense it into a new clean tube.\n The validated procedure has been saved to the file: Protocol-7ac5", "================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: stage-2\n\nBased on the validated protocol, I will now generate the Python code to execute the experiment. This will automate the steps for DNA template removal and siRNA clean-up.\n\nI will use the `Code` agent for this purpose.\n\n- `code_request_id`: I will provide the file ID of the validated protocol, which is `Protocol-7ac5`. This file contains the detailed steps of the experiment that the `Code` agent will translate into executable code.\n- `pure_software`: I am setting this to `False` because this is a wet lab experiment that involves interacting with hardware and reagents, not just a software simulation.\n- `inputs_from_previous_stage`: The input for this stage is the `synthesized_ssRNA_solution` from the previous stage. The previous stage's output states, \"The final product is stored in the container 'synthesized_ssRNA_solution' with a volume of 20.0 \u00b5L.\" I will pass this information to the `Code` agent to ensure the code correctly identifies and uses the output from the previous experiment as the input for this one.\n- `multiple_inputs`: I will leave this parameter empty. Although the user mentioned purifying products from 3 parallel transcription reactions, the previous stage's output indicates that the final product is stored in a single container, 'synthesized_ssRNA_solution'. Therefore, we will treat it as a single input for this stage.\nTool Calls:\n  Code (d794ea21-8979-4702-adc5-6bea95159d14)\n Call ID: d794ea21-8979-4702-adc5-6bea95159d14\n  Args:\n    code_request_id: Protocol-7ac5\n    inputs_from_previous_stage: The final product is stored in the container 'synthesized_ssRNA_solution' with a volume of 20.0 \u00b5L.\n    pure_software: False", "================================= Tool Message =================================\nName: Code\n\nresult: Code-c86a", "================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: stage-2\n\nI have chosen to use the `Hardware` agent to execute the experiment.\n\n### Reason for choosing this agent:\nThe previous step successfully generated the necessary Python code for the experimental procedure.

This script details the precise steps for the hardware to follow.\n- `repeat_num`: The user has specified that there are products from \"3 parallel transcription reactions\" that need to be purified. Therefore, I am setting this parameter to `3` to ensure the experiment is run for each of the three samples.\n- `pure_software`: I am leaving this parameter as its default `False` value because this is a wet lab experiment that involves physical reagents and hardware, not just a software simulation.\nTool Calls:\n  Hardware (ac22b5d0-4d43-4497-967a-d872a8cc3072)\n Call ID: ac22b5d0-4d43-4497-967a-d872a8cc3072\n  Args:\n    repeat_num: 3.0\n    file_ids: ['Code-c86a']", "================================= Tool Message =================================\nName: Hardware\n\nHere is the result history:\nResult 0: {'Time': '3h13min', 'siRNA yield': 'good'}\nResult 1: {'Time': '3h', 'siRNA yield': 'good'}\n\nFinal product in container 'final_sirna_product' with volume 15.0 uL.\n"]}
