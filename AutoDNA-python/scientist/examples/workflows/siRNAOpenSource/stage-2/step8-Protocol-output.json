{"content": "Part 1: DNA Template Removal\n\n    Step 1.1: Perform nuclease digestion to remove DNA templates from the in vitro transcription reaction.\n\n        Option 1.1.1: DNase I treatment using Zymo Research protocol.\n            - Component A: RNA sample (\u2264 10 \u00b5g)\n            - Component B: water or TE buffer\n            - Component C: DNase I (reconstituted; 1 U/\u00b5l)\n                - Recipe: Reconstitute one vial of lyophilized DNase I (250 U) with 275 \u00b5l of DNase/RNase-Free Water.\n            - Component D: DNA Digestion Buffer\n            - Operational details:\n                1. In a separate RNase-free tube, prepare a 50 \u00b5l DNase I Reaction Mix for each sample.\n                2. Combine 5 \u00b5l of DNA Digestion Buffer and 5 \u00b5l of reconstituted DNase I (1 U/\u00b5l).\n                3. Add the RNA sample (up to 40 \u00b5l).\n                4. If the sample volume is less than 40 \u00b5l, adjust the total volume to 50 \u00b5l with water or TE buffer.\n                5. Mix gently by inverting the tube.\n                6. Incubate at room temperature (20-30\u00b0C) for 15 minutes.\n\nPart 2: siRNA Clean-up\n\n    Step 2.1: Purify the siRNA from the reaction mixture.\n\n        Option 2.1.1: Magnetic bead-based clean-up (Zymo Research protocol).\n            - Component A: RNA MagBinding Buffer\n            - Component B: MagBinding Beads\n            - Component C: 100% isopropanol\n            - Component D: RNA Prep Buffer\n            - Component E: ethanol (95-100%)\n            - Component F: DNase/RNase-Free Water\n            - Operational details:\n                1. To a 50 \u00b5l sample (e.g., from Option 1.1.1), add 150 \u00b5l of RNA MagBinding Buffer and mix well.\n                2. Add 15 \u00b5l of MagBinding Beads (ensure beads are fully resuspended before use) and mix well.\n                3. Add 250 \u00b5l of 100% isopropanol and mix well for 15 minutes.\n                4. Place the tube on a magnetic stand until the beads form a pellet, then aspirate and discard the cleared supernatant.\n                5. Remove from the magnetic stand, add 500 \u00b5l of RNA Prep Buffer, and mix well.\n                6. Return the tube to the magnetic stand, wait for the beads to pellet, and discard the supernatant.\n                7. Remove from the magnetic stand, add 500 \u00b5l of ethanol (95-100%), and mix well.\n                8. Return the tube to the magnetic stand, wait for the beads to pellet, and discard the supernatant.\n                9. Repeat the ethanol wash: Add another 500 \u00b5l of ethanol (95-100%) and mix well.\n                10. With the mixture in the tube, transfer the entire sample (beads and ethanol) to a new RNase-free tube.\n                11. Place the new tube on the magnetic stand, wait for the beads to pellet, and discard the supernatant.\n                12. Air-dry the beads at room temperature for approximately 10 minutes, or until fully dry.\n                13. To elute the RNA, remove the tube from the stand, add 15 \u00b5l of DNase/RNase-Free Water, and mix well for 5 minutes.\n                14. Return the tube to the magnetic stand, wait for the beads to pellet completely, then aspirate the cleared, eluted RNA and dispense it into a new clean tube.\n The validated procedure has been saved to the file: Protocol-7ac5"}
