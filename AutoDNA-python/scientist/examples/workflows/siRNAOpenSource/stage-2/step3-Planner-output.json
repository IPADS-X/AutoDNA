{"content": "I have chosen the `Protocol` agent to generate a detailed experimental procedure for the purification of siRNA.\n\nHere's my reasoning for selecting this agent and its parameters:\n\n*   **`experiment_name`**: I've set this to \"DNA template removal and siRNA clean-up\" to clearly define the goal of this experimental stage. This ensures the generated protocol is focused on the correct task.\n*   **`file_ids`**: I am providing the file ID `['Literature-996a']`, which contains the output from our earlier literature search. This file details several methods for DNA removal and siRNA purification. By providing this context, I am guiding the `Protocol` agent to use one of the methods described in the literature, specifically the one that seems most efficient and modern: the Zymo Research RNA Clean & Concentrator\u2122 MagBead kit. This kit-based approach is generally more reliable and less hazardous than older methods like phenol/chloroform extraction.\n*   **`pure_software`**, **`retry`**, **`manuals`**: I have left these parameters empty.\n    *   This is not a purely software-based task, so `pure_software` is not applicable.\n    *   This is the first attempt at generating a protocol for this stage, so `retry` is unnecessary.\n    *   While the literature search provided information, it's not a formal instrument manual, so I am not including it in the `manuals` parameter. The relevant information is already in the `file_ids`.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"experiment_name": "DNA template removal and siRNA clean-up", "file_ids": ["Literature-996a"]}, "id": "6d1edfea-e01e-4524-b9e5-dd04a027d15c", "type": "tool_call"}]}
