{"content": "I will start by searching the literature for a suitable protocol for DNA template removal and siRNA clean-up after in vitro transcription. This will provide the foundational information needed to generate a specific experimental procedure. I will then use this information to create a detailed protocol, check for the availability of the necessary reagents, and finally generate and execute the code for the purification process. The experiment name will be \"DNA template removal and siRNA clean-up\", and the question for the literature search will be \"How to remove DNA template and clean up siRNA from in vitro transcription reaction?\". This will ensure that the subsequent steps are based on established scientific methods.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Literature", "args": {"experiment_name": "DNA template removal and siRNA clean-up", "questions": ["How to remove DNA template and clean up siRNA from in vitro transcription reaction?"]}, "id": "4e3de0f9-b5b3-4935-8317-28745dde14a4", "type": "tool_call"}]}
