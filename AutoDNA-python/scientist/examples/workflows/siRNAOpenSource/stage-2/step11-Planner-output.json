{"content": "I have chosen to use the `Hardware` agent to execute the experiment.\n\n### Reason for choosing this agent:\nThe previous step successfully generated the necessary Python code for the experimental procedure. The `Hardware` agent is the designated tool for executing such code on the lab's equipment. This is the final step in carrying out the requested \"DNA template removal and siRNA clean-up\" stage.\n\n### Reason for filling the params:\n- `file_ids`: I am providing the file ID `Code-c86a`, which contains the Python script generated in the previous step by the `Code` agent. This script details the precise steps for the hardware to follow.\n- `repeat_num`: The user has specified that there are products from \"3 parallel transcription reactions\" that need to be purified. Therefore, I am setting this parameter to `3` to ensure the experiment is run for each of the three samples.\n- `pure_software`: I am leaving this parameter as its default `False` value because this is a wet lab experiment that involves physical reagents and hardware, not just a software simulation.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Hardware", "args": {"repeat_num": 3.0, "file_ids": ["Code-c86a"]}, "id": "ac22b5d0-4d43-4497-967a-d872a8cc3072", "type": "tool_call"}]}
