{"content": "Based on the validated protocol, I will now generate the Python code to execute the experiment. This will automate the steps for DNA template removal and siRNA clean-up.\n\nI will use the `Code` agent for this purpose.\n\n- `code_request_id`: I will provide the file ID of the validated protocol, which is `Protocol-7ac5`. This file contains the detailed steps of the experiment that the `Code` agent will translate into executable code.\n- `pure_software`: I am setting this to `False` because this is a wet lab experiment that involves interacting with hardware and reagents, not just a software simulation.\n- `inputs_from_previous_stage`: The input for this stage is the `synthesized_ssRNA_solution` from the previous stage. The previous stage's output states, \"The final product is stored in the container 'synthesized_ssRNA_solution' with a volume of 20.0 \u00b5L.\" I will pass this information to the `Code` agent to ensure the code correctly identifies and uses the output from the previous experiment as the input for this one.\n- `multiple_inputs`: I will leave this parameter empty. Although the user mentioned purifying products from 3 parallel transcription reactions, the previous stage's output indicates that the final product is stored in a single container, 'synthesized_ssRNA_solution'. Therefore, we will treat it as a single input for this stage.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Code", "args": {"code_request_id": "Protocol-7ac5", "inputs_from_previous_stage": "The final product is stored in the container 'synthesized_ssRNA_solution' with a volume of 20.0 \u00b5L.", "pure_software": false}, "id": "d794ea21-8979-4702-adc5-6bea95159d14", "type": "tool_call"}]}
