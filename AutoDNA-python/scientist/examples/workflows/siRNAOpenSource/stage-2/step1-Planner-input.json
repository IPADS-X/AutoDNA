You must give your reason on why you fill in the param of that agent the way you do( even you leave the param empty ). This reasoning part must be super detailed. \nIf you want to pass information from one agent to another, you MUST fill in the file_id(or file_ids) param of the agent with the id of the file that contains the information you want to pass.\nIf you think it's time to stop, you must output in a format shown below:\n### workflow ### \n(Summarize the workflow you have done)\n### final_result ### \n(The final result of the executions)\n------------------------------------\nA hypothesis must be considered invalidated if neither of its requested reagents is available.\n", "================================ Human Message =================================\n\n\nResult from Previous Stage:\nThe experiment for DNA template in vitro transcription to synthesize single-stranded siRNA has been successfully completed in 3 parallel runs. The average time for each run was 3 hours and 13 minutes, and the synthesis yielded a good amount of siRNA. The final product is stored in the container 'synthesized_ssRNA_solution' with a volume of 20.0 \u00b5L.\n---\nCurrent Stage Goal: DNA template removal and siRNA clean-up\n\n---\nRequirement for this stage:\nPurify the products from the 3 parallel transcription reactions.\n---\n\nPlease focus ONLY on executing this current stage."]}
