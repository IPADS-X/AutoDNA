{"content": "### workflow ###\nThe user initiated the \"DNA template removal and siRNA clean-up\" stage for a previously synthesized siRNA solution.\n\nFirst, I utilized the `Literature` agent to gather established methods for this purification process. The query focused on \"How to remove DNA template and clean up siRNA from in vitro transcription reaction?\". The agent returned several methods, including nuclease treatments and various clean-up techniques like phenol/chloroform extraction and magnetic bead-based purification.\n\nNext, I used the `Protocol` agent, feeding it the information from the literature search, to generate a comprehensive experimental procedure. This initial protocol included multiple options for both DNA removal and siRNA clean-up, detailing the necessary reagents and steps for each.\n\nTo ensure the feasibility of the generated protocol, I then called the `Reagent` agent. The purpose of this step was to check the availability of all the reagents listed in the initial protocol against the lab's inventory. The agent reported that several key reagents for the enzymatic and precipitation-based methods were unavailable.\n\nWith the reagent availability information, I called the `Protocol` agent again. This time, the goal was to validate and filter the initial procedure, removing the options that required unavailable reagents. This resulted in a refined and practical protocol that exclusively used the available Zymo Research kit reagents for both DNase treatment and magnetic bead-based clean-up.\n\nFollowing the protocol validation, I used the `Code` agent to translate the validated procedure into an executable Python script. The agent was also provided with the information about the starting material from the previous stage.\n\nFinally, I executed the generated script using the `Hardware` agent. The experiment was run in triplicate to process the products from the three parallel reactions of the previous stage. The successful execution of this stage resulted in the purification of the siRNA.\n### final_result ###\nThe DNA template removal and siRNA clean-up stage has been successfully completed. The final purified siRNA product is stored in the container 'final_sirna_product' with a volume of 15.0 \u00b5L.", "tool_calls": []}
