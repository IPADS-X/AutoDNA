This method utilizes T7 RNA Polymerase to efficiently synthesize single-stranded RNA from a linear double-stranded DNA template containing a T7 promoter sequence (In2021 pages 1-5).\n\n### Template DNA Preparation for siRNA Synthesis\n\nThe first step in producing siRNA is to prepare double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that incorporate the desired siRNA sequence and a T7 promoter sequence (In2021 pages 1-5).\n\n#### Oligonucleotide Design\nTwo sets of double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides are prepared. Each set includes a T7 promoter sequence and a template sequence (sense or anti-sense chain) (In2021 pages 1-5).\n*   **Sense chain template:**\n    5'-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNTT-3'\n    3'-ATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNAA-5' (In2021 pages 1-5)\n*   **Anti-sense chain template:**\n    5'-AANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3'\n    3'-TTNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGATATCACTCAGCATAAT-5' (In2021 pages 1-5)\n\nFor efficient transcription, approximately six arbitrary bases should be added upstream (5' end) of the T7 promoter sequence. For example, adding GATCAC has been found to be optimal (In2021 pages 1-5).\n\nAn experimental example for synthesizing siRNA against Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) uses the following four single-stranded oligo DNAs (In2021 pages 1-5):\n*   **Oligo-1:** 5'-GATCACTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGGAGTTGTCCCAATTCTTGTT-3'\n*   **Oligo-2:** 3'-CTAGTGATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCCCTCAACAGGGTTAAGAACAA-5'\n*   **Oligo-3:** 5'-AAGGAGTTGTCCCAATTCTTGCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGTGATC-3'\n*   **Oligo-4:** 3'-TTCCTCAACAGGGTTAAGAACGGGATATCACTCAGCATAATCACTAG-5' (In2021 pages 1-5)\n\n#### Double-stranded Oligo DNA Preparation (Annealing)\n1.  Dissolve the synthesized single-stranded oligo DNA in sterile distilled water to prepare a 100 pmol/\u03bcl DNA solution (In2021 pages 1-5).\n2.  Prepare the oligo DNA annealing reaction solution with the following components (In2021 pages 1-5):\n    *   10\u00d7 Annealing Buffer: 2 \u03bcl\n    *   100 pmol/\u03bcl Oligo A\\*: 2 \u03bcl\n    *   100 pmol/\u03bcl Oligo B\\*: 2 \u03bcl\n    *   Sterile water: 14 \u03bcl\n    \\*Oligo A and B must be paired: Oligo-1 with Oligo-2, and Oligo-3 with Oligo-4 (In2021 pages 1-5). The 10\u00d7 Annealing Buffer composition is 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM CH3COOK, 10 mM EDTA (In2021 pages 1-5).\n3.  Place the annealing reaction solution on a PCR amplifier and treat it at 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes (In2021 pages 1-5).\n4.  Follow this with an annealing phase consisting of a gradual cooling ramp to 25\u00b0C over 45 minutes, and a subsequent 10-minute hold (In2021 pages 1-5). This process anneals the single-stranded oligo DNAs to form double-stranded oligo DNA at a concentration of 10 pmol/\u03bcl. This solution can be used as template DNA and stored at -20\u00b0C when not in use (In2021 pages 1-5).\n\n### In vitro Transcription Reaction\n\nThe *in vitro* transcription reaction synthesizes sense and anti-sense RNAs simultaneously, which can then form double strands (In2021 pages 1-5).\n1.  Prepare the RNA *in vitro* transcription reaction solution according to the following components (In2021 pages 8-14):\n    *   10\u00d7 Transcription Buffer: 2 \u03bcl\n    *   ATP Solution (50 mM): 2 \u03bcl\n    *   GTP Solution (50 mM): 2 \u03bcl\n    *   CTP Solution (50 mM): 2 \u03bcl\n    *   UTP Solution (50 mM): 2 \u03bcl\n    *   RNase Inhibitor (40 U/\u03bcl): 0.5 \u03bcl\n    *   T7 RNA Polymerase (50 U/\u03bcl): 2 \u03bcl\n    *   RNase-free dH2O: X \u03bcl (to bring total volume to 20 \u03bcl)\n    *   10 pmol/\u03bcl double-stranded oligo DNA solution (Oligo-1/-2)\\*: 1 \u03bcl\n    *   10 pmol/\u03bcl double-stranded oligo DNA solution (Oligo-3/-4)\\*: 1 \u03bcl\n    *   Total volume: 20 \u03bcl (In2021 pages 8-14)\n    \\*The 10\u00d7 Transcription Buffer contains spermidine, which can form complexes with nucleic acids and cause precipitation; therefore, template DNA must be added last (In2021 pages 8-14). The reaction system can be scaled up or down as appropriate (In2021 pages 8-14).\n2.  Evenly mix the solutions and centrifuge gently to collect the transcription reaction solution at the bottom of the tube (In2021 pages 8-14).\n3.  Incubate the mixture at 42\u00b0C for 2 hours (In2021 pages 8-14). A portion of the reaction solution can be used for gel electrophoresis to confirm the RNA product (In2021 pages 8-14).\n\n### Nuclease Treatment\n\nAfter the transcription reaction, nuclease treatment is performed to digest template DNA and specific RNA strands (In2021 pages 1-5).\n\n#### DNase I Treatment\nTo remove template DNA oligonucleotides, perform DNase treatment (In2021 pages 1-5):\n1.  After the transcription reaction, add 10-20 U/20 \u03bcl of RNase-free DNase I (5 U/\u03bcl) (In2021 pages 5-8, In2021 pages 1-5).\n2.  Mix well and incubate at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes (In2021 pages 5-8).\n\n#### RNase T1 Treatment\nRNase T1 degrades the GGG portion of one RNA strand, which is part of the siRNA production process (In2021 pages 1-5).\n1.  Add the following solutions to the reaction tube after *in vitro* transcription and DNase treatment (In2021 pages 8-14):\n    *   RNase-free DNase I (5 U/\u03bcl): 2 \u03bcl\n    *   RNase T1 (4 U/\u03bcl)\\*: 1 \u03bcl\n    \\*RNase T1 from the kit should be diluted to 4 U/\u03bcl using RNase T1 Dilution Buffer and used as soon as possible without storage (In2021 pages 8-14).\n2.  Incubate at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours (In2021 pages 8-14).\n\n### siRNA Purification\n\nAfter nuclease treatment, the siRNA with a 2-base overhang at the 3' end is purified and recovered (In2021 pages 1-5).\n\n#### Phenol/Chloroform Extraction and Isopropanol Precipitation\nThis method is performed as follows (In2021 pages 5-8):\n1.  If the reaction volume is less than 100 \u03bcl, add RNase-free dH2O to make up to 100 \u03bcl (In2021 pages 5-8).\n2.  Add an equal volume of phenol (pH 4.5)/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), stir with a vortex, and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm at room temperature for 2 minutes (In2021 pages 5-8).\n3.  Transfer the upper layer (aqueous layer) to a new tube and add an equal volume of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Vortex and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm at room temperature for 2 minutes (In2021 pages 5-8).\n4.  Transfer the upper (aqueous) layer to a new tube, add 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate and an equal volume of isopropanol, and mix thoroughly (In2021 pages 5-8).\n5.  After standing at room temperature for 5 minutes, centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 5 minutes (In2021 pages 5-8).\n6.  Remove the supernatant and wash the precipitate with 80% ethanol (In2021 pages 5-8).\n7.  After drying, dissolve the precipitate in 1% RNase-free dH2O or TE Buffer (In2021 pages 5-8). If necessary, aliquot and store at -20\u00b0C to -70\u00b0C (In2021 pages 5-8).\n\nAn alternative purification method for siRNA, as described in the experimental example, is as follows (In2021 pages 8-14):\n1.  Add an equal volume of water-saturated acidic phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) to the reaction solution (In2021 pages 8-14). Mix thoroughly and centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature (In2021 pages 8-14).\n2.  Transfer the upper (aqueous) layer to a new centrifuge tube (In2021 pages 8-14). Add an equal volume of 5 M ammonium acetate (pH 5.6) and four times the volume of 99.5% ethanol (In2021 pages 8-14). Let stand at room temperature for 5 minutes, then centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes (In2021 pages 8-14).\n3.  Remove the supernatant, add 100 \u03bcl of 80% ethanol, and centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 5 minutes (In2021 pages 8-14).\n4.  Remove the supernatant, dry slightly, and add 20-50 \u03bcl of RNase Free dH2O (In2021 pages 8-14).\n5.  Measure the OD260 of the solution and confirm RNA purity by gel electrophoresis (In2021 pages 8-14).\n\nIf the above purification method cannot completely remove nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) or if the reaction system is scaled up, it is recommended to use CHROMA SPIN\u2122+TE-30 columns (Code No. 636069) (In2021 pages 8-14).\n\n#### Commercial Purification Products\nFor transcribed RNA size > 200 bases, the following commercial products can also be used (In2021 pages 5-8):\n*   NucleoSpin RNA Clean-up (740948.10/740948.50/740948.250) (In2021 pages 5-8)\n*   NucleoSpin RNA Clean-up XS (740903.10/740903.50/740903.250) (In2021 pages 5-8)\n The information has been saved to the file: Literature-48e3", "================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: stage-1\n\nI will use the `Protocol` agent to generate an experimental protocol.\n\nHere is my reasoning for the parameters I've chosen:\n- `experiment_name`: I'm setting this to \"in vitro transcription of DNA template to synthesize single-stranded siRNA\" to reflect the user's goal for this stage.

This will help us determine which parts of the experiment are feasible with our current inventory.\n\nI am providing the following parameters to the Protocol agent:\n- `experiment_name`: \"in vitro transcription of DNA template to synthesize single-stranded siRNA\". This is the high-level goal of our experiment.\n- `file_ids`: A list containing two file IDs:\n    - `Protocol-4f71`: This file contains the detailed experimental procedure that we generated in the previous step. It includes all the steps and reagents required for the experiment.\n    - `Reagent-35fc`: This file contains the results of our reagent availability check. It lists which reagents are available and which are not.\n\nBy providing both of these files, I am instructing the Protocol agent to take the procedure from `Protocol-4f71` and validate it against the reagent list in `Reagent-35fc`. The agent will then output a new, filtered procedure that only includes the steps for which we have the necessary materials. This will give us a clear understanding of what parts of the experiment we can currently perform and what we cannot.
