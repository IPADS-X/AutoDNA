{"content": "I have received the validated procedure and will now generate the necessary Python code to execute the experiment.\n\nThe validated procedure outlines the steps for preparing the double-stranded DNA template and then using it for in vitro transcription to synthesize the sense strand single-stranded RNA. Since the user requested 3 parallel runs, the code will be set up to repeat the process three times.\n\nI will call the `Code` agent to translate the validated protocol into an executable Python script.\n\n**`Code` Agent Call Reasoning:**\n\n*   **`code_request_id`**: I am providing `\"Protocol-8090\"`, which is the file ID of the validated procedure. This file contains the precise steps, reagents, and conditions that the `Code` agent needs to convert into a Python script.\n*   **`pure_software`**: I am setting this to `False` because this experiment involves physical reagents and laboratory hardware (like a PCR machine and incubator), not just a computer simulation.\n*   **`multiple_inputs`**: I am leaving this parameter empty. The user's requirement is for \"3 parallel runs,\" which means the same experimental procedure with the same inputs will be repeated three times. It does not involve testing different sets of inputs.\n*   **`inputs_from_previous_stage`**: I am leaving this empty as well. The inputs for this stage (Oligo-1, Oligo-2, etc.) are explicitly defined within the provided protocol and are not variable outputs from a previous, unmentioned stage.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Code", "args": {"code_request_id": "Protocol-8090", "pure_software": false}, "id": "eeb36c46-37d1-453c-887c-035298b62399", "type": "tool_call"}]}
