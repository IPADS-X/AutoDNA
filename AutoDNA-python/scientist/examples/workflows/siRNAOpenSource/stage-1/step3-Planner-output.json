{"content": "I will use the `Protocol` agent to generate an experimental protocol.\n\nHere is my reasoning for the parameters I've chosen:\n- `experiment_name`: I'm setting this to \"in vitro transcription of DNA template to synthesize single-stranded siRNA\" to reflect the user's goal for this stage. This will provide the necessary context for the agent to generate a relevant protocol.\n- `file_ids`: I'm passing the file ID `[Literature-48e3]` which contains the detailed procedure from the literature search. This will ensure the generated protocol is based on the scientifically sound method I've already identified.\n- `pure_software`: I'm leaving this parameter empty since this experiment involves wet lab procedures, not just software.\n- `retry`: I'm leaving this empty as this is the first attempt to generate the protocol.\n- `manuals`: I'm leaving this empty as no specific instrument or reagent manuals have been identified as necessary at this stage.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"experiment_name": "in vitro transcription of DNA template to synthesize single-stranded siRNA", "file_ids": ["Literature-48e3"]}, "id": "2acff105-be41-4f1c-b3e2-cf2d17c49d99", "type": "tool_call"}]}
