{"content": "*In vitro* transcription of a DNA template to synthesize single-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) involves several key steps: template DNA preparation, the *in vitro* transcription reaction, nuclease treatment, and siRNA purification. This method utilizes T7 RNA Polymerase to efficiently synthesize single-stranded RNA from a linear double-stranded DNA template containing a T7 promoter sequence (In2021 pages 1-5).\n\n### Template DNA Preparation for siRNA Synthesis\n\nThe first step in producing siRNA is to prepare double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that incorporate the desired siRNA sequence and a T7 promoter sequence (In2021 pages 1-5).\n\n#### Oligonucleotide Design\nTwo sets of double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides are prepared. Each set includes a T7 promoter sequence and a template sequence (sense or anti-sense chain) (In2021 pages 1-5).\n*   **Sense chain template:**\n    5'-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNTT-3'\n    3'-ATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNAA-5' (In2021 pages 1-5)\n*   **Anti-sense chain template:**\n    5'-AANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3'\n    3'-TTNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGATATCACTCAGCATAAT-5' (In2021 pages 1-5)\n\nFor efficient transcription, approximately six arbitrary bases should be added upstream (5' end) of the T7 promoter sequence. For example, adding GATCAC has been found to be optimal (In2021 pages 1-5).\n\nAn experimental example for synthesizing siRNA against Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) uses the following four single-stranded oligo DNAs (In2021 pages 1-5):\n*   **Oligo-1:** 5'-GATCACTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGGAGTTGTCCCAATTCTTGTT-3'\n*   **Oligo-2:** 3'-CTAGTGATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCCCTCAACAGGGTTAAGAACAA-5'\n*   **Oligo-3:** 5'-AAGGAGTTGTCCCAATTCTTGCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAGTGATC-3'\n*   **Oligo-4:** 3'-TTCCTCAACAGGGTTAAGAACGGGATATCACTCAGCATAATCACTAG-5' (In2021 pages 1-5)\n\n#### Double-stranded Oligo DNA Preparation (Annealing)\n1.  Dissolve the synthesized single-stranded oligo DNA in sterile distilled water to prepare a 100 pmol/\u03bcl DNA solution (In2021 pages 1-5).\n2.  Prepare the oligo DNA annealing reaction solution with the following components (In2021 pages 1-5):\n    *   10\u00d7 Annealing Buffer: 2 \u03bcl\n    *   100 pmol/\u03bcl Oligo A\\*: 2 \u03bcl\n    *   100 pmol/\u03bcl Oligo B\\*: 2 \u03bcl\n    *   Sterile water: 14 \u03bcl\n    \\*Oligo A and B must be paired: Oligo-1 with Oligo-2, and Oligo-3 with Oligo-4 (In2021 pages 1-5). The 10\u00d7 Annealing Buffer composition is 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM CH3COOK, 10 mM EDTA (In2021 pages 1-5).\n3.  Place the annealing reaction solution on a PCR amplifier and treat it at 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes (In2021 pages 1-5).\n4.  Follow this with an annealing phase consisting of a gradual cooling ramp to 25\u00b0C over 45 minutes, and a subsequent 10-minute hold (In2021 pages 1-5). This process anneals the single-stranded oligo DNAs to form double-stranded oligo DNA at a concentration of 10 pmol/\u03bcl. This solution can be used as template DNA and stored at -20\u00b0C when not in use (In2021 pages 1-5).\n\n### In vitro Transcription Reaction\n\nThe *in vitro* transcription reaction synthesizes sense and anti-sense RNAs simultaneously, which can then form double strands (In2021 pages 1-5).\n1.  Prepare the RNA *in vitro* transcription reaction solution according to the following components (In2021 pages 8-14):\n    *   10\u00d7 Transcription Buffer: 2 \u03bcl\n    *   ATP Solution (50 mM): 2 \u03bcl\n    *   GTP Solution (50 mM): 2 \u03bcl\n    *   CTP Solution (50 mM): 2 \u03bcl\n    *   UTP Solution (50 mM): 2 \u03bcl\n    *   RNase Inhibitor (40 U/\u03bcl): 0.5 \u03bcl\n    *   T7 RNA Polymerase (50 U/\u03bcl): 2 \u03bcl\n    *   RNase-free dH2O: X \u03bcl (to bring total volume to 20 \u03bcl)\n    *   10 pmol/\u03bcl double-stranded oligo DNA solution (Oligo-1/-2)\\*: 1 \u03bcl\n    *   10 pmol/\u03bcl double-stranded oligo DNA solution (Oligo-3/-4)\\*: 1 \u03bcl\n    *   Total volume: 20 \u03bcl (In2021 pages 8-14)\n    \\*The 10\u00d7 Transcription Buffer contains spermidine, which can form complexes with nucleic acids and cause precipitation; therefore, template DNA must be added last (In2021 pages 8-14). The reaction system can be scaled up or down as appropriate (In2021 pages 8-14).\n2.  Evenly mix the solutions and centrifuge gently to collect the transcription reaction solution at the bottom of the tube (In2021 pages 8-14).\n3.  Incubate the mixture at 42\u00b0C for 2 hours (In2021 pages 8-14). A portion of the reaction solution can be used for gel electrophoresis to confirm the RNA product (In2021 pages 8-14).\n\n### Nuclease Treatment\n\nAfter the transcription reaction, nuclease treatment is performed to digest template DNA and specific RNA strands (In2021 pages 1-5).\n\n#### DNase I Treatment\nTo remove template DNA oligonucleotides, perform DNase treatment (In2021 pages 1-5):\n1.  After the transcription reaction, add 10-20 U/20 \u03bcl of RNase-free DNase I (5 U/\u03bcl) (In2021 pages 5-8, In2021 pages 1-5).\n2.  Mix well and incubate at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes (In2021 pages 5-8).\n\n#### RNase T1 Treatment\nRNase T1 degrades the GGG portion of one RNA strand, which is part of the siRNA production process (In2021 pages 1-5).\n1.  Add the following solutions to the reaction tube after *in vitro* transcription and DNase treatment (In2021 pages 8-14):\n    *   RNase-free DNase I (5 U/\u03bcl): 2 \u03bcl\n    *   RNase T1 (4 U/\u03bcl)\\*: 1 \u03bcl\n    \\*RNase T1 from the kit should be diluted to 4 U/\u03bcl using RNase T1 Dilution Buffer and used as soon as possible without storage (In2021 pages 8-14).\n2.  Incubate at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours (In2021 pages 8-14).\n\n### siRNA Purification\n\nAfter nuclease treatment, the siRNA with a 2-base overhang at the 3' end is purified and recovered (In2021 pages 1-5).\n\n#### Phenol/Chloroform Extraction and Isopropanol Precipitation\nThis method is performed as follows (In2021 pages 5-8):\n1.  If the reaction volume is less than 100 \u03bcl, add RNase-free dH2O to make up to 100 \u03bcl (In2021 pages 5-8).\n2.  Add an equal volume of phenol (pH 4.5)/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), stir with a vortex, and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm at room temperature for 2 minutes (In2021 pages 5-8).\n3.  Transfer the upper layer (aqueous layer) to a new tube and add an equal volume of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Vortex and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm at room temperature for 2 minutes (In2021 pages 5-8).\n4.  Transfer the upper (aqueous) layer to a new tube, add 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate and an equal volume of isopropanol, and mix thoroughly (In2021 pages 5-8).\n5.  After standing at room temperature for 5 minutes, centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 5 minutes (In2021 pages 5-8).\n6.  Remove the supernatant and wash the precipitate with 80% ethanol (In2021 pages 5-8).\n7.  After drying, dissolve the precipitate in 1% RNase-free dH2O or TE Buffer (In2021 pages 5-8). If necessary, aliquot and store at -20\u00b0C to -70\u00b0C (In2021 pages 5-8).\n\nAn alternative purification method for siRNA, as described in the experimental example, is as follows (In2021 pages 8-14):\n1.  Add an equal volume of water-saturated acidic phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) to the reaction solution (In2021 pages 8-14). Mix thoroughly and centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature (In2021 pages 8-14).\n2.  Transfer the upper (aqueous) layer to a new centrifuge tube (In2021 pages 8-14). Add an equal volume of 5 M ammonium acetate (pH 5.6) and four times the volume of 99.5% ethanol (In2021 pages 8-14). Let stand at room temperature for 5 minutes, then centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes (In2021 pages 8-14).\n3.  Remove the supernatant, add 100 \u03bcl of 80% ethanol, and centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 5 minutes (In2021 pages 8-14).\n4.  Remove the supernatant, dry slightly, and add 20-50 \u03bcl of RNase Free dH2O (In2021 pages 8-14).\n5.  Measure the OD260 of the solution and confirm RNA purity by gel electrophoresis (In2021 pages 8-14).\n\nIf the above purification method cannot completely remove nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) or if the reaction system is scaled up, it is recommended to use CHROMA SPIN\u2122+TE-30 columns (Code No. 636069) (In2021 pages 8-14).\n\n#### Commercial Purification Products\nFor transcribed RNA size > 200 bases, the following commercial products can also be used (In2021 pages 5-8):\n*   NucleoSpin RNA Clean-up (740948.10/740948.50/740948.250) (In2021 pages 5-8)\n*   NucleoSpin RNA Clean-up XS (740903.10/740903.50/740903.250) (In2021 pages 5-8)\n The information has been saved to the file: Literature-48e3"}
