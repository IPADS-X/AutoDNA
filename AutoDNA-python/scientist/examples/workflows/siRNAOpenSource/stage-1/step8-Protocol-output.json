Place the tube on a PCR amplifier. Heat at 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes. Gradually cool the mixture to 25\u00b0C over 45 minutes. Hold at 25\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The resulting solution contains the double-stranded oligo DNA solution (Oligo-1/-2) at a concentration of 10 pmol/\u03bcl. Store at -20\u00b0C.)\n\nPart 2: In Vitro Transcription for Single-Stranded RNA Synthesis\n\n    Step 2.1: Assembly of the in vitro transcription reaction\n\n        Option 2.1.1: Synthesize sense strand single-stranded RNA.\n            - Component A: 10\u00d7 Transcription Buffer\n            - Component B: ATP Solution (50 mM)\n            - Component C: GTP Solution (50 mM)\n            - Component D: CTP Solution (50 mM)\n            - Component E: UTP Solution (50 mM)\n            - Component F: RNase Inhibitor (40 U/\u03bcl)\n            - Component G: T7 RNA Polymerase (50 U/\u03bcl)\n            - Component H: RNase-free dH2O\n            - Component I: 10 pmol/\u03bcl double-stranded oligo DNA solution (Oligo-1/-2)\n            (operational details: For a 20 \u03bcl reaction, combine 2 \u03bcl of 10\u00d7 Transcription Buffer, 2 \u03bcl each of 50 mM ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP solutions, 0.5 \u03bcl of RNase Inhibitor, 2 \u03bcl of T7 RNA Polymerase, and 6.5 \u03bcl of RNase-free dH2O. Mix gently. Finally, add 1 \u03bcl of the 10 pmol/\u03bcl double-stranded oligo DNA solution (Oligo-1/-2). The template DNA must be added last as the spermidine in the buffer can cause precipitation. Mix the final solution evenly and centrifuge briefly to collect the contents at the bottom of the tube.)\n\n    Step 2.2: Incubation for RNA synthesis\n\n        Option 2.2.1: Incubate the transcription reaction mixture.\n            (operational details: Incubate the reaction mixture from Step 2.1 at 42\u00b0C for 2 hours.)\n The validated procedure has been saved to the file: Protocol-8090"}
