You must give your reason on why you fill in the param of that agent the way you do( even you leave the param empty ). This reasoning part must be super detailed. \nIf you want to pass information from one agent to another, you MUST fill in the file_id(or file_ids) param of the agent with the id of the file that contains the information you want to pass.\nIf you think it's time to stop, you must output in a format shown below:\n### workflow ### \n(Summarize the workflow you have done)\n### final_result ### \n(The final result of the executions)\n", "================================ Human Message =================================\n\nDesign and implement a nucleic acid test experiment based on RPA isothermal amplification. The experiment requires a total of six fluorescence readings per sample, taking one reading every 5 minutes, with the initial reading starting at time zero. A sample is considered positive if its fluorescence value exceeds three times the fluorescence value of the NTC (No Template Control).\nThis experiment involves 8 batches to be individually tested in a sequential manner, with each group prepared in triplicate that requires simultaneous testing. The batches are: \n- Negative Control: NC-1, NC-2, NC-3\n- No Template Control: NTC-1, NTC-2, NTC-3\n- Sample1: Sample1-1, Sample1-2, Sample1-3\n- Sample2: Sample2-1, Sample2-2, Sample2-3\n- Sample3: Sample3-1, Sample3-2, Sample3-3\n- Sample4: Sample4-1, Sample4-2, Sample4-3\n- Sample5: Sample5-1, Sample5-2, Sample5-3\n- Sample6: Sample6-1, Sample6-2, Sample6-3\nEach test in the batches comprises 3 individual pre-made components: a sample replicate, its RPA reagent buffer, and its Reaction Initiator, stored in uncapped and low-retention tubes initially."]}
