The `Reagent` agent is designed for this specific purpose.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the parameters I will use for the `Reagent` agent:\n- `reagent_query_id`: I will set this to `Protocol-d12e`, which is the file ID of the protocol containing the reagent list.

This means the Reaction Initiator is a pre-made solution.\n- The initial protocol listed \"Magnesium Acetate Solution\" as a sub-component of the Reaction Initiator, which could imply it needs to be mixed. To avoid confusion and ensure the procedure is executable with the available materials, I need to refine the protocol to clarify that the Reaction Initiator is a single, pre-aliquoted solution.\n- The `Protocol` agent's \"Procedure Refinement\" capability is perfectly suited for this task.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the parameters I will use for the `Protocol` agent:\n- `experiment_name`: I will keep this as \"Nucleic acid test based on RPA isothermal amplification\" to maintain consistency with the experimental goal.\n- `file_ids`: I will provide the file IDs of both the original protocol (`Protocol-d12e`) and the reagent check result (`Reagent-23a5`). This is crucial because it gives the `Protocol` agent the full context: the original plan and the inventory constraints that necessitate the adjustment.

This ensures the generated code will accurately reflect the steps we've carefully defined.\n- `pure_software`: I am leaving this with its default `False` value, as this experiment clearly involves interacting with physical lab hardware (the fluorescence reader).\n- `multiple_inputs`: I am leaving this parameter empty. The protocol involves processing several different batches of samples, but the core procedure for each batch is identical. The code can handle the different sample names through a list or loop, so we don't need to define them as separate, distinct inputs at this stage.\n- `inputs_from_previous_stage`: I am leaving this parameter empty as the protocol file itself contains all the necessary information for generating the code. There are no computational results from a prior step that need to be passed into this one.\nTool Calls:\n  Code (call_b6b7a161555247b0b2a081d0a3e2f427)\n Call ID: call_b6b7a161555247b0b2a081d0a3e2f427\n  Args:\n    code_request_id: Protocol-6131", "================================= Tool Message =================================\nName: Code\n\nresult: Code-853b", "================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: stage-1\nTool Calls:\n  Hardware (call_0bfe865639f240c2998ccb67fb643dc2)\n Call ID: call_0bfe865639f240c2998ccb67fb643dc2\n  Args:\n    file_ids: ['Code-853b']\n    repeat_num: 1", "================================= Tool Message =================================\nName: Hardware\n\nHere is the result history:\nResult 0: {'Time': '8h', 'Fluorescence values': 'NTC:1007, NC:1016, Sample1:5848, Sample2:16132, Sample3:21857, Sample4:22972, Sample5:26546, Sample6:26561'}\n\r\nBelow are Just Mockup results.
