Generate the experiment_name parameter for the following experiment description(output only the parameter value):
------------------------------
Design and implement a nucleic acid test experiment based on RPA isothermal amplification. The experiment requires a total of six fluorescence readings per sample, taking one reading every 5 minutes, with the initial reading starting at time zero. A sample is considered positive if its fluorescence value exceeds three times the fluorescence value of the NTC (No Template Control).
This experiment involves 8 batches to be individually tested in a sequential manner, with each group prepared in triplicate that requires simultaneous testing. The batches are: 
- Negative Control: NC-1, NC-2, NC-3
- No Template Control: NTC-1, NTC-2, NTC-3
- Sample1: Sample1-1, Sample1-2, Sample1-3
- Sample2: Sample2-1, Sample2-2, Sample2-3
- Sample3: Sample3-1, Sample3-2, Sample3-3
- Sample4: Sample4-1, Sample4-2, Sample4-3
- Sample5: Sample5-1, Sample5-2, Sample5-3
- Sample6: Sample6-1, Sample6-2, Sample6-3
Each test in the batches comprises 3 individual pre-made components: a sample replicate, its RPA reagent buffer, and its Reaction Initiator, stored in uncapped and low-retention tubes initially.
