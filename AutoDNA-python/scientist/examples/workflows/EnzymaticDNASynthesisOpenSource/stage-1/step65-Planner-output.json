{"content": "I will now generate a modified experimental protocol by increasing the concentration of the ZaTdT-R335L-K337G enzyme based on the latest hypothesis. This is to further optimize the stepwise yield, aiming to get closer to the state-of-the-art yield of 98.7%. I'm using the `Protocol` agent, passing the current successful procedure (`Protocol-ef78`) and the new hypothesis (`Hypothesis-fc96`) as inputs, along with relevant manuals. The `experiment_name` remains \"enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT\", `pure_software` is `False` since this is a physical experiment, and `retry` is `False` as we are refining rather than re-attempting a failed protocol.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"manuals": ["beads-manual", "3-ONH2-dnTP-manual"], "pure_software": false, "experiment_name": "enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT", "file_ids": ["Protocol-ef78", "Hypothesis-fc96"], "retry": false}, "id": "0040eb85-ecc2-4e09-ae94-408505396836", "type": "tool_call"}]}
