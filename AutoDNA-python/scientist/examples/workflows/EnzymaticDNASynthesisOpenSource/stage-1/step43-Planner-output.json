{"content": "My reasoning for the next step is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the current state:**\n    *   The initial experiment yielded a \"Stepwise yield\" of 94.07% (from `Hardware_response` in the first execution).\n    *   The state-of-the-art stepwise yield is 98.7%.\n    *   The current stepwise yield is significantly lower than the SOTA.\n    *   The previous attempt to optimize the stepwise yield by repeating the deblocking step (using `Hypothesis-c476`) resulted in a *lower* stepwise yield of 90.86% (from `Hardware_response` in the second execution) and increased time, indicating this hypothesis was ineffective. Therefore, I rolled back to the previous successful procedure (`Protocol-b5fc`).\n    *   The next hypothesis (`Hypothesis-9423`) was to increase the pH of the sodium acetate buffer during deblocking. However, the `Reagent` tool (Reagent-8fb1) indicated that the required \"1 M aqueous sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8\" was *not available*, rendering this hypothesis invalid.\n    *   The subsequent hypothesis (`Hypothesis-8485`) was to modify the 1X B&W Buffer by omitting EDTA to prevent chelation of CoCl2. However, the `Reagent` tool (Reagent-59ca) indicated that \"EDTA-free 1X B&W Buffer\" was *not available*, but \"B&W Buffer is available: 2X, components: Tris-HCl, EDTA, NaCl\". This implies that a buffer *with* EDTA is available, but the EDTA-free version is not directly procurable, invalidating this hypothesis without additional preparation steps (which are not supported by the current tools).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the latest valid hypothesis:**\n    *   The last generated hypothesis (`Hypothesis-360c`) suggests adding 0.01-0.1% Tween-20 to the 1X Binding & Washing (B&W) Buffer to prevent bead aggregation, which might be hindering enzyme access and thus reducing yield.\n    *   The `Reagent` tool (Reagent-3db8) reports that \"Tween-20: available, 1%\". While the desired `1X B&W Buffer (modified recipe: 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20)` is listed as \"not available\", the base \"B&W Buffer is available: 2X, components: Tris-HCl, EDTA, NaCl\". This means the *components* for the modified buffer are available, and the lab can prepare the 1X buffer with the addition of Tween-20. This makes the hypothesis *valid* and actionable with the available reagents.\n\n3.  **Plan the next steps:**\n    *   **Call `Protocol`:** I will call the `Protocol` agent to modify the existing protocol (`Protocol-b5fc`) based on the new hypothesis (`Hypothesis-360c`). I will pass the `manuals` information as well to ensure all relevant information is considered.\n    *   **Call `Code`:** After generating the modified protocol, I will call the `Code` agent to convert it into an executable Python script.\n    *   **Call `Hardware`:** Finally, I will execute the generated code using the `Hardware` agent, repeating the experiment 4 times as requested, to measure the new stepwise yield and time. This will allow me to assess the effectiveness of the hypothesis.\n\nThis iterative process of hypothesizing, modifying the protocol, generating code, and executing the experiment will continue until the optimization targets are met or further optimization is not possible under the given constraints.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Code", "args": {"pure_software": false, "code_request_id": "Protocol-91c0"}, "id": "cc1d2211-a6d3-4b74-8738-136c85339dd8", "type": "tool_call"}]}
