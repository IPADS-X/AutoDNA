{"messages": ["================================ System Message ================================\n\n\nUpon an agent calling, you must TELL the user with detailed explanation of your reasoning for choosing it. You must give your reason on why you fill in the param of that agent the way you do( even you leave the param empty ). This reasoning part must be super detailed. \nIf you want to pass information from one agent to another, you MUST fill in the file_id(or file_ids) param of the agent with the id of the file that contains the information you want to pass.\nIf you think it's time to stop, you must output in a format shown below:\n### workflow ### \n(Summarize the workflow you have done)\n### final_result ### \n(The final result of the executions)\n------------------------------------\nA hypothesis must be considered invalidated if neither of its requested reagents is available.\n", "================================ Human Message =================================\n\nDesign and optimize an enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis experiment(the target DNA sequence ACTCTGAT) to achieve a state-of-the-art stepwise yield while minimizing time. Repeat the experiment 4 times so that the measured yield is more accurate.\nWhen minimizing time, the maximum allowable drop from the state-of-the-art stepwise yield is 1%. When the stepwise yield drops more than 1% of the SOTA stepwise yield, you must stop optimizing.\nWhen you finish all target optimization, output the complete procedure that is exactly the same as the best procedure."]}
