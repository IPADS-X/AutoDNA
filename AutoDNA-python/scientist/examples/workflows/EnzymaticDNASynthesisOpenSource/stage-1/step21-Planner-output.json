{"content": "I will now run the experiment with the updated protocol (Protocol-1b1e) that incorporates the optimization hypothesis of repeating the deblocking step. This is done to improve the stepwise yield. I will run the experiment 4 times to ensure the accuracy of the measured yield. After execution, I will evaluate the new stepwise yield and time, comparing them against the state-of-the-art and the specified acceptable drop.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Code", "args": {"pure_software": false, "code_request_id": "Protocol-1b1e"}, "id": "3ee8a804-281c-4323-b9d1-bbcd5829e894", "type": "tool_call"}]}
