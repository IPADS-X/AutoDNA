{"content": "I am going to use the `Hypothesis` agent to generate an optimization advice to improve the stepwise yield.\nI will set `current_optimize_target` to \"stepwise yield\" because the current yield (94.07%) is below the acceptable threshold (97.7%).\nI will set `current_procedure_id` to \"Protocol-b5fc\" because this is the ID of the procedure that produced the last result I want to optimize.\nI will include the `manuals` from the previous steps, which are \"beads-manual\" and \"3-ONH2-dnTP-manual\", as they might contain useful information for generating optimization hypotheses.\nI will set `roll_back_num` to 1. This means that the last 1 optimization attempt was deemed ineffective and will be discarded. The previous attempt to optimize the stepwise yield by repeating the deblocking step resulted in a lower yield (90.86%), so I am discarding that. The subsequent attempt to adjust the pH of the deblocking buffer was invalidated due to reagent unavailability. The attempt to remove EDTA from the wash buffer was also invalidated due to reagent unavailability. Thus, I need to roll back to the state before the pH change attempt and the EDTA removal attempt, which effectively means rolling back to the `Protocol-b5fc`.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Hypothesis", "args": {"manuals": ["beads-manual", "3-ONH2-dnTP-manual"], "current_procedure_id": "Protocol-b5fc", "roll_back_num": 1.0, "current_optimize_target": "stepwise yield"}, "id": "51dd8dd9-1476-4f72-841b-c1c08d5e17ae", "type": "tool_call"}]}
