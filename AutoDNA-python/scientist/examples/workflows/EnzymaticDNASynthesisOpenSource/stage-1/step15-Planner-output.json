{"content": "I will call the `Hardware` agent to execute the experiment.\nMy reasoning for choosing this agent is that I have a validated experimental procedure that has been translated into executable Python code. The `Hardware` agent is responsible for running this code, which in turn controls the physical lab equipment to perform the synthesis. This is the execution step of the workflow.\n\nI will set the `file_ids` param to `[\"Code-7476\", \"Code-8a8c\"]` because these are the files containing the Python scripts generated by the `Code` agent in the previous step.\nI will set the `repeat_num` param to `4` as requested by the user, to ensure the measured yield is accurate.\nI will set `pure_software` to `False` because this is a wet lab experiment involving physical reagents and instruments, not just a simulation.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Hardware", "args": {"file_ids": ["Code-7476", "Code-8a8c"], "pure_software": false, "repeat_num": 4}, "id": "call_df1add26c530499399bfa036a04618fb", "type": "tool_call"}]}
