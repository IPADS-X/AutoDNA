{"content": "I am continuing the optimization process. I have evaluated the previous experiment's outcome. The initial stepwise yield was 94.07%, which is below the target of 97.7% (98.7% SOTA - 1% allowable drop).\n\nI then generated and tested a hypothesis (Hypothesis-c476) to repeat the deblocking reaction, which unfortunately led to a decrease in yield to 90.86%. This means that repeating the deblocking step was not effective and actually detrimental.\n\nTherefore, I rolled back to the previous successful procedure (Protocol-b5fc) and generated a new hypothesis (Hypothesis-9423) that acidic deblocking causes depurination, suggesting to increase the pH of the deblocking buffer to pH 5.8. However, the reagent (1 M aqueous sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8) was not available.\n\nConsequently, I rolled back again to `Protocol-b5fc` and generated another hypothesis (Hypothesis-8485). This current hypothesis suggests that residual EDTA from the wash buffer might be chelating the essential CoCl2 cofactor for the TdT enzyme, thereby hindering its activity. To address this, the proposed optimization is to remove EDTA from the 1X Binding & Washing (B&W) Buffer used in the washing steps.\n\nI have just generated a new protocol (`Protocol-eeb6`) incorporating this latest hypothesis.\n\nNow, I will check the availability of the new reagent specified in `Protocol-eeb6` to ensure we have all necessary components before proceeding to code generation and experiment execution.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Reagent", "args": {"reagent_query_id": "Protocol-eeb6"}, "id": "e97dd78a-4fad-4ce6-960f-992d02786cb6", "type": "tool_call"}]}
