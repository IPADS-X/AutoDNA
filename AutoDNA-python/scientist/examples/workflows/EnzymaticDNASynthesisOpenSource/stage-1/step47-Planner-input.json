This average stepwise yield was achieved over 10 cycles of synthesis using an engineered terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) variant (Lu2022 pages 5-5).\n\n**General Procedure for Enzymatic *de novo* DNA Synthesis of ACTCTGAT**\n\nEnzymatic *de novo* DNA synthesis, also known as template-independent enzymatic oligonucleotide synthesis (TiEOS), involves the stepwise addition of nucleotides to an initiator DNA strand without a template (Hoose2023 pages 4-5). This process typically uses TdT, an enzyme that elongates oligonucleotides in the 5\u02b9-to-3\u02b9 direction (Hoose2023 pages 4-5). To control the incorporation of a single nucleotide per reaction step, a \"reversible termination\" mechanism is employed, utilizing nucleoside 5\u02b9-triphosphates (NTPs) modified with a synthesis-interrupting protecting group (PG) at the 3\u02b9 position (Hoose2023 pages 4-5). This PG is subsequently removed to allow the incorporation of the next desired nucleotide (Hoose2023 pages 4-5).\n\nA detailed procedure for synthesizing an 8-nucleotide sequence like ACTCTGAT, based on an optimized TiEOS method, is as follows:\n\n1.  **Initiator Preparation:** A 5\u2032-biotinylated oligonucleotide (referred to as P2 in Supplementary Table 7 of Lu2022/Lu2023) is immobilized onto streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-270 Streptavidin, Dynal Biotech) (Lu2023 pages 4-7). All subsequent reactions are performed on these magnetic beads (Lu2023 pages 4-7).\n2.  **Enzyme:** The engineered ZaTdT-R335L-K337G variant of TdT is used (Lu2022 pages 5-5). This variant has been tailored to enhance its catalytic activity with 3\u2032-ONH2-modified nucleotides (Lu2022 pages 5-5).\n3.  **Nucleotides:** 3\u2032-ONH2-modified deoxynucleoside triphosphates (3\u2032-ONH2-dNTPs) from Firebird Biomolecular Sciences, LLC, US, are used as substrates (Lu2023 pages 4-7).\n4.  **Reaction System (per cycle):** The reaction system for each nucleotide addition comprises:\n    *   1 \u03bcM immobilized oligonucleotides (P2) (Lu2023 pages 4-7).\n    *   0.25 mM CoCl2, which is the preferred metal cofactor for 3\u2032-ONH2 nucleotide incorporation (Lu2022 pages 5-5, Lu2023 pages 4-7).\n    *   100 mM NaCl (Lu2023 pages 4-7).\n    *   50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) (Lu2023 pages 4-7).\n    *   0.25 mM of the specific 3\u2032-ONH2-dNTP required for the current cycle (Lu2023 pages 4-7).\n    *   1 mg/mL of the TdT-mutant (ZaTdT-R335L-K337G) (Lu2023 pages 4-7).\n    The context does not specify the total volume of the reaction mixture for the synthesis steps.\n5.  **Elongation Cycle (8 cycles for ACTCTGAT):** The synthesis proceeds in a two-step oligonucleotide synthesis cycle, repeated for each nucleotide in the target sequence (Lu2022 pages 5-5, Lu2023 pages 4-7). The sequence ACTCTGAT requires 8 cycles.\n    *   **Coupling (Step 1):** The reaction mixture, including the TdT-mutant and the specific 3\u2032-ONH2-dNTP, is incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 10 min (Lu2023 pages 4-7).\n    *   **Washing (Step 2):** After coupling, the cleavage buffer is removed, and the magnetic beads are washed using lysis buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl) (Lu2023 pages 4-7). The context does not specify the volume of lysis buffer or the number of washes.\n    *   **Deblocking (Step 3):** The products are treated with sodium nitrite buffer (700 mM, pH 5, adjusted with nitrous acid) to cleave the 3\u2032-ONH2 group, thereby generating a free 3\u2032-OH group for the next cycle (Lu2023 pages 4-7). The context does not specify the volume of sodium nitrite buffer or the incubation time for deblocking.\n    The subsequent cycles of reaction, washing, and deblocking follow the same steps as described for the first cycle (Lu2023 pages 4-7). The modified nucleotides are added in the following order to synthesize ACTCTGAT:\n    *   Cycle 1: 3\u2032-ONH2-dATP\n    *   Cycle 2: 3\u2032-ONH2-dCTP\n    *   Cycle 3: 3\u2032-ONH2-dTTP\n    *   Cycle 4: 3\u2032-ONH2-dCTP\n    *   Cycle 5: 3\u2032-ONH2-dTTP\n    *   Cycle 6: 3\u2032-ONH2-dGTP\n    *   Cycle 7: 3\u2032-ONH2-dATP\n    *   Cycle 8: 3\u2032-ONH2-dTTP\n6.  **Post-synthesis:** Upon completion of all 8 cycles, the synthesized product can be purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Lu2023 pages 4-7).\n\n**Options for Protecting Groups (PGs):**\nWithin the TiEOS framework, various 3\u2032-protecting groups (PGs) for NTPs have been developed to facilitate controlled, stepwise nucleotide addition:\n*   **3\u2032-ONH2-protected NTPs:** Used by companies like DNA Script (Hoose2023 pages 6-7).\n*   **Azidomethyl terminators (3\u2032-O-N3-NTP):** Preferred by companies such as Nuclera Nucleics and Molecular Assemblies (Hoose2023 pages 6-7, Hoose2023 pages 7-8, Fig. 3B).\n*   **2-nitrobenzyl (3\u2032-O-2-nitrobenzyl):** Favored by Camena Bioscience (Hoose2023 pages 6-7, Hoose2023 pages 7-8, Fig. 3B).\n*   **Tethered TdT-nucleotide conjugates:** ANSA Biotechnologies employs a strategy where TdT is tethered to the base of an incoming NTP via a cleavable linker, which sterically shields the 3\u2032-OH and prevents the formation of homopolymeric nucleotide tracts (Hoose2023 pages 7-8, Fig. 3C).\n The information has been saved to the file: Literature-9736", "================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: stage-1\n\nI will call the `Protocol` agent to generate an initial experimental procedure.\nMy reasoning for choosing this agent is that I need to create a detailed experimental plan based on the information I've gathered from the literature search.

This means the last optimization attempt (repeating the deblocking reaction) was ineffective.\n\nNow, I will use the `Hypothesis` agent to generate a new optimization hypothesis. I will set `roll_back_num = 1` because the last optimization (which was based on the hypothesis `Hypothesis-c476`) did not lead to an improvement and in fact made the yield worse. This will revert the procedure to the state before the last optimization attempt was applied, and a new hypothesis will be generated from that state.\n\nMy reasoning for the parameters:\n- `current_optimize_target`: The user wants to optimize \"stepwise yield\" and \"time\". Since the primary constraint is the stepwise yield not dropping more than 1% from SOTA, and the `Hypothesis` agent only supports a single target, I will continue to prioritize \"stepwise yield\" as the immediate optimization target. Once the yield is acceptable, I will focus on time.\n- `roll_back_num`: The previous optimization attempt (repeating deblocking) resulted in a lower yield and higher time, indicating it was ineffective. Therefore, I need to \"roll back\" that change.

This file contains the updated protocol, which includes the modified recipe for the 1X Binding & Washing (B&W) Buffer that now incorporates Tween-20, as well as checking for the availability of Tween-20 itself. This step is crucial to ensure that the proposed optimization can be carried out with available lab resources.\nTool Calls:\n  Reagent (e09c86f8-7e58-4556-b1c9-e1c9535c727e)\n Call ID: e09c86f8-7e58-4556-b1c9-e1c9535c727e\n  Args:\n    reagent_query_id: Protocol-91c0", "================================= Tool Message =================================\nName: Reagent\n\nTween-20: available, 1%\n1X B&W Buffer: not available.

Therefore, I rolled back to the previous successful procedure (`Protocol-b5fc`).\n    *   The next hypothesis (`Hypothesis-9423`) was to increase the pH of the sodium acetate buffer during deblocking. However, the `Reagent` tool (Reagent-8fb1) indicated that the required \"1 M aqueous sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8\" was *not available*, rendering this hypothesis invalid.\n    *   The subsequent hypothesis (`Hypothesis-8485`) was to modify the 1X B&W Buffer by omitting EDTA to prevent chelation of CoCl2. However, the `Reagent` tool (Reagent-59ca) indicated that \"EDTA-free 1X B&W Buffer\" was *not available*, but \"B&W Buffer is available: 2X, components: Tris-HCl, EDTA, NaCl\". This implies that a buffer *with* EDTA is available, but the EDTA-free version is not directly procurable, invalidating this hypothesis without additional preparation steps (which are not supported by the current tools).\n\n2.  **Evaluate the latest valid hypothesis:**\n    *   The last generated hypothesis (`Hypothesis-360c`) suggests adding 0.01-0.1% Tween-20 to the 1X Binding & Washing (B&W) Buffer to prevent bead aggregation, which might be hindering enzyme access and thus reducing yield.\n    *   The `Reagent` tool (Reagent-3db8) reports that \"Tween-20: available, 1%\". While the desired `1X B&W Buffer (modified recipe: 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20)` is listed as \"not available\", the base \"B&W Buffer is available: 2X, components: Tris-HCl, EDTA, NaCl\". This means the *components* for the modified buffer are available, and the lab can prepare the 1X buffer with the addition of Tween-20. This makes the hypothesis *valid* and actionable with the available reagents.\n\n3.  **Plan the next steps:**\n    *   **Call `Protocol`:** I will call the `Protocol` agent to modify the existing protocol (`Protocol-b5fc`) based on the new hypothesis (`Hypothesis-360c`). I will pass the `manuals` information as well to ensure all relevant information is considered.\n    *   **Call `Code`:** After generating the modified protocol, I will call the `Code` agent to convert it into an executable Python script.\n    *   **Call `Hardware`:** Finally, I will execute the generated code using the `Hardware` agent, repeating the experiment 4 times as requested, to measure the new stepwise yield and time. This will allow me to assess the effectiveness of the hypothesis.\n\nThis iterative process of hypothesizing, modifying the protocol, generating code, and executing the experiment will continue until the optimization targets are met or further optimization is not possible under the given constraints.\nTool Calls:\n  Code (cc1d2211-a6d3-4b74-8738-136c85339dd8)\n Call ID: cc1d2211-a6d3-4b74-8738-136c85339dd8\n  Args:\n    pure_software: False\n    code_request_id: Protocol-91c0", "================================= Tool Message =================================\nName: Code\n\nresult: Code-5f57", "================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: stage-1\n\nMy reasoning for selecting the `Hardware` agent is to execute the latest experimental Python code, which incorporates the optimization hypothesis of adding Tween-20 to the wash buffer to prevent bead aggregation and improve enzyme access.
