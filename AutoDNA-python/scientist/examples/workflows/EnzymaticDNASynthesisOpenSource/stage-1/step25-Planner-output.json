{"content": "I've completed the second hardware execution with the modified protocol (repeating the deblocking step). The result is a stepwise yield of 90.86% and a time of 7h44min. This is a *decrease* in stepwise yield from the previous experiment (94.07%) and an *increase* in time. This means the last optimization attempt (repeating the deblocking reaction) was ineffective.\n\nNow, I will use the `Hypothesis` agent to generate a new optimization hypothesis. I will set `roll_back_num = 1` because the last optimization (which was based on the hypothesis `Hypothesis-c476`) did not lead to an improvement and in fact made the yield worse. This will revert the procedure to the state before the last optimization attempt was applied, and a new hypothesis will be generated from that state.\n\nMy reasoning for the parameters:\n- `current_optimize_target`: The user wants to optimize \"stepwise yield\" and \"time\". Since the primary constraint is the stepwise yield not dropping more than 1% from SOTA, and the `Hypothesis` agent only supports a single target, I will continue to prioritize \"stepwise yield\" as the immediate optimization target. Once the yield is acceptable, I will focus on time.\n- `roll_back_num`: The previous optimization attempt (repeating deblocking) resulted in a lower yield and higher time, indicating it was ineffective. Therefore, I need to \"roll back\" that change. Setting `roll_back_num = 1` will discard the last optimization hypothesis and its associated protocol changes, allowing the agent to generate a new hypothesis from the state of the experiment *before* that last, unsuccessful optimization.\n- `current_procedure_id`: This refers to the procedure that led to the `Result 1` which is `Protocol-3737`.\n- `manuals`: I will pass the same manuals (`beads-manual`, `3-ONH2-dnTP-manual`) that have been used throughout the process, as they contain relevant information for the experiment.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Hypothesis", "args": {"manuals": ["beads-manual", "3-ONH2-dnTP-manual"], "current_procedure_id": "Protocol-3737", "roll_back_num": 1.0, "current_optimize_target": "stepwise yield"}, "id": "b01bf3ab-3e40-485e-95c8-99b0505c6e0d", "type": "tool_call"}]}
