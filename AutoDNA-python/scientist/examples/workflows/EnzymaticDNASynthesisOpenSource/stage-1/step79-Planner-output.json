{"content": "I will call the `Hypothesis` agent to get an optimization advice for the current procedure.\nMy reasoning for choosing this agent is that I want to continue optimizing the experiment to minimize the time, as the last time optimization was successful. The `Hypothesis` agent can provide me with a new optimization advice based on the current best procedure.\n\nI will set the `current_optimize_target` param to `time` because my current goal is to reduce the experiment time.\nI will set the `current_procedure_id` param to `Protocol-18bd` because this is the ID of the procedure that produced the best result so far (6h, 98.00% yield).\nI will set the `roll_back_num` param to `0` because the last optimization was successful and I don't want to discard it.\nI will set the `manuals` param to `['beads-manual', '3-ONH2-dnTP-manual']` to provide the agent with all the relevant information.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Hypothesis", "args": {"current_optimize_target": "time", "current_procedure_id": "Protocol-18bd", "manuals": ["beads-manual", "3-ONH2-dnTP-manual"], "roll_back_num": 0}, "id": "call_4434809b84c546a19b569e5c81f94ba0", "type": "tool_call"}]}
