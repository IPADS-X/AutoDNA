{"content": "I will call the `Code` agent to generate the Python code for the modified procedure.\nMy reasoning for this is that the `Protocol` agent has just generated a new procedure (`Protocol-a3d4`) that incorporates the time-saving optimization of reducing the magnetic separation time. To execute this new procedure, I need to convert it into a format that the `Hardware` agent can understand, which is Python code.\n\nI will set the `code_request_id` param to `Protocol-a3d4` to specify which procedure to convert.\nI will set the `pure_software` param to `False` as this is a wet lab experiment.\nI will leave the other params empty as they are not relevant in this context.\n\nAfter generating the code, I will call the `Hardware` agent to execute it and see if the time has been reduced while keeping the stepwise yield within the acceptable range.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Code", "args": {"code_request_id": "Protocol-a3d4", "pure_software": false}, "id": "call_72b5cd16e44a4a138f5028254a150f73", "type": "tool_call"}]}
