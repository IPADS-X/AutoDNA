{"content": "I am generating a new hypothesis for optimizing the enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis experiment. Previously, I tried to improve the stepwise yield by repeating the deblocking step, but this resulted in a decrease in yield. Therefore, I am rolling back to the previous best procedure, which yielded 94.07%.\n\nMy new hypothesis addresses a potential issue with the wash buffer. I suspect that residual EDTA in the 1X Binding & Washing (B&W) Buffer might be chelating the CoCl2 cofactor, which is essential for the TdT enzyme's activity. If CoCl2 is chelated, the enzyme's efficiency would be reduced, leading to a lower stepwise yield.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, I will modify the protocol by removing the 0.5 mM EDTA component from the 1X Binding & Washing (B&W) Buffer in Steps 1.2 and 1.4. This change aims to prevent the chelation of CoCl2 and potentially improve the enzyme's performance and, consequently, the stepwise yield.\n\nI will use the `Protocol` tool to update the procedure.\n- `experiment_name`: \"enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT\" - This remains the same as the overall goal of the experiment has not changed.\n- `file_ids`: I will provide `Protocol-b5fc`, which is the current best procedure, and `Hypothesis-8485`, which contains the new optimization advice. This ensures the `Protocol` agent has access to both the baseline procedure and the proposed modification.\n- `manuals`: I will include `beads-manual` and `3-ONH2-dnTP-manual` because these manuals contain relevant information about the reagents and are still important for the procedure.\n- `pure_software`: `False` - The experiment involves physical reagents and laboratory steps, so it is not purely software-based.\n- `retry`: `False` - I am modifying an existing procedure based on a new hypothesis, not attempting to regenerate a procedure from scratch due to numerous failures.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"pure_software": false, "manuals": ["beads-manual", "3-ONH2-dnTP-manual"], "file_ids": ["Protocol-b5fc", "Hypothesis-8485"], "experiment_name": "enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT", "retry": false}, "id": "8f456118-45aa-4130-bb3f-f00ee5ac6b5c", "type": "tool_call"}]}
