{"content": "I am calling the `default_api.Reagent` tool to verify the availability of the \"1 M aqueous sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8\" as specified in the previous optimization hypothesis.\n\nThe previous `Hypothesis` agent suggested increasing the pH of the sodium acetate buffer from 5.5 to 5.8. The `Reagent` agent has now informed me that the \"1 M aqueous sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8\" is *not available*. Instead, a \"Aqueous Sodium Acetate Buffer, pH 5.5\" is available.\n\nAccording to the rule, \"A hypothesis must be considered invalidated if neither of its requested reagents is available.\" Since the specific reagent at pH 5.8 is not available, and using the pH 5.5 buffer would mean not actually testing the hypothesis of pH 5.8, the current optimization hypothesis is invalidated.\n\nTherefore, I need to roll back the optimization attempt that suggested changing the pH and generate a new hypothesis. The `roll_back_num` should be 1 to discard the last, unsuccessful optimization attempt. I will generate a new hypothesis based on the procedure at `Protocol-b5fc`.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Hypothesis", "args": {"manuals": ["beads-manual", "3-ONH2-dnTP-manual"], "current_procedure_id": "Protocol-b5fc", "roll_back_num": 1.0, "current_optimize_target": "stepwise yield"}, "id": "629e5d59-2d1f-4400-bef0-f2676b703e91", "type": "tool_call"}]}
