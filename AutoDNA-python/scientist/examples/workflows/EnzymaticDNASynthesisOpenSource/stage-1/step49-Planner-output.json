{"content": "I will now generate an optimization hypothesis to improve the stepwise yield.\nMy reasoning for using the `Hypothesis` tool is to get advice on how to optimize the current experimental procedure to reach the desired state-of-the-art stepwise yield.\n\nI am filling in the `current_optimize_target` parameter with \"stepwise yield\" because the primary goal at this stage is to improve the yield.\nI am filling in the `current_procedure_id` parameter with \"Protocol-aceb\" because this is the ID of the most recent procedure that was executed, and it serves as the base for the next optimization attempt.\nI am filling in the `manuals` parameter with `[\"beads-manual\", \"3-ONH2-dnTP-manual\"]` as these are the relevant manuals that were identified earlier in the process and might contain information useful for generating an optimization hypothesis.\nI am filling in the `roll_back_num` parameter with `0` because the last optimization attempt resulted in an improvement (from 94.07% to 95.72%), so we do not need to roll back any previous changes.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"manuals": ["beads-manual", "3-ONH2-dnTP-manual"], "pure_software": false, "experiment_name": "enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT", "file_ids": ["Protocol-aceb", "Hypothesis-9666"], "retry": false}, "id": "321147d2-7930-408b-ae6b-d5575fa8391e", "type": "tool_call"}]}
