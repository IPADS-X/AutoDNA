{"content": "I will use the `Protocol` agent.\nMy reasoning for choosing the `Protocol` agent is to apply the new optimization hypothesis (Hypothesis-360c) to the existing experimental procedure (Protocol-b5fc). This agent is designed to adjust or modify an existing procedure based on new information or feedback.\n\nI will fill the `experiment_name` parameter with \"enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT\" as this is the ongoing experiment.\nI will fill the `file_ids` parameter with a list containing \"Protocol-b5fc\" and \"Hypothesis-360c\". \"Protocol-b5fc\" represents the current best experimental procedure before the last failed attempt (which resulted in a rollback). \"Hypothesis-360c\" contains the new optimization advice to be incorporated into the procedure.\nI will fill the `manuals` parameter with a list containing \"beads-manual\" and \"3-ONH2-dnTP-manual\". These manuals were identified as relevant during the initial reagent check and should continue to be available for procedure refinement.\nI will set the `pure_software` parameter to `False` because this experiment involves physical hardware and reagents.\nI will set the `retry` parameter to `False` because I am applying a specific optimization hypothesis, not regenerating a procedure due to multiple failures.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"manuals": ["beads-manual", "3-ONH2-dnTP-manual"], "pure_software": false, "file_ids": ["Protocol-b5fc", "Hypothesis-360c"], "experiment_name": "enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT", "retry": false}, "id": "8ea9283a-dd58-4970-88ce-130e75f3a0fb", "type": "tool_call"}]}
