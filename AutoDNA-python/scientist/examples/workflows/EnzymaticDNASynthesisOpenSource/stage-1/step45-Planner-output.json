{"content": "My reasoning for selecting the `Hardware` agent is to execute the latest experimental Python code, which incorporates the optimization hypothesis of adding Tween-20 to the wash buffer to prevent bead aggregation and improve enzyme access. This execution will provide new experimental results, including the stepwise yield and time, allowing me to evaluate the effectiveness of this optimization. I need to repeat the experiment 4 times to ensure the accuracy of the measured yield.\n\nI am passing `file_ids=['Code-5f57']` to specify the Python script generated from the latest optimized protocol.\nI am setting `pure_software=False` because this is a wet-lab experiment involving physical reagents and hardware.\nI am setting `repeat_num=4` as instructed by the user to achieve a more accurate yield measurement.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Hardware", "args": {"pure_software": false, "file_ids": ["Code-5f57"], "repeat_num": 4.0}, "id": "af45e8c1-9e9a-4145-9afd-936e890c33f0", "type": "tool_call"}]}
