{"content": "I am using the `Protocol` tool to modify the existing experimental procedure based on the generated hypothesis.\n\nMy reasoning for the parameters is as follows:\n- `experiment_name`: I am setting this to \"enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT\" to clearly define the experiment that is being modified.\n- `file_ids`: I am passing a list containing \"Protocol-b5fc\" and \"Hypothesis-c476\". \"Protocol-b5fc\" is the ID of the current experimental procedure that needs to be optimized. \"Hypothesis-c476\" is the ID of the file containing the optimization advice to repeat the deblocking reaction. This ensures that the `Protocol` tool has all the necessary information to modify the procedure.\n- `manuals`: I am including \"beads-manual\" and \"3-ONH2-dnTP-manual\" as these manuals were previously identified as relevant to the experiment and might contain information useful for refining the protocol based on the new hypothesis.\n- `pure_software`: I am setting this to `False` because this experiment involves physical hardware and chemical reagents, not just software.\n- `retry`: I am setting this to `False` because the previous procedure did not completely fail, but rather we are in an optimization loop. Therefore, we are refining an existing procedure rather than regenerating a new one from scratch due to extensive failures.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"manuals": ["beads-manual", "3-ONH2-dnTP-manual"], "pure_software": false, "experiment_name": "enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT", "file_ids": ["Protocol-b5fc", "Hypothesis-c476"], "retry": false}, "id": "1bd2edcf-6cb1-4d5e-a883-1ee54ad2c602", "type": "tool_call"}]}
