{"content": "Part 1: Iterative Synthesis of ACTCTGAT\n\n    Step 1.1: Coupling Reaction (First Nucleotide Addition: A)\n\n        Option 1.1.1: TdT-mediated incorporation of 3\u2032-ONH2-dATP in phosphate buffer.\n            - Component A: Immobilized initiator oligonucleotide on beads (at 1 \u00b5M final concentration)\n            - Component B: ZaTdT-R335L-K337G (at 1 mg/mL final concentration)\n            - Component C: 3\u2032-ONH2-dATP (at 0.25 mM final concentration, purified as in Part 2)\n            - Component D: CoCl2 (at 0.25 mM final concentration)\n            - Component E: phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) (at 50 mM final concentration)\n            - Component F: NaCl (at 100 mM final concentration)\n            (Operational details: Combine all components, ensuring they are prepared with HPLC-grade water and free from aldehyde/ketone contamination. Incubate the reaction mixture at 30 \u00b0C for 10 min with gentle tilting and rotation to keep beads suspended.)\n\n    Step 1.2: Post-Coupling Wash\n\n        Option 1.2.1: Wash beads with 1X Binding & Washing (B&W) Buffer.\n            - Component A: Beads from Step 1.1\n            - Component B: 1X B&W Buffer\n                - Recipe: 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl\n            (Operational details: Use a magnetic stand to separate the beads for 2 minutes. Remove the supernatant. Add 1X B&W Buffer, resuspend the beads, separate, and discard the supernatant. Repeat wash cycles 2-3 times.)\n\n    Step 1.3: Deblocking Reaction\n\n        Option 1.3.1: Cleavage of the 3\u2032-ONH2 protecting group using sodium nitrite in acetate buffer.\n            - Component A: Washed beads from Step 1.2\n            - Component B: Cleavage Reagent\n                - Recipe: 700 mM NaNO2 in 1 M aqueous sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8\n            (Operational details: Resuspend the beads in the Cleavage Reagent and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes with gentle rotation. This step may be repeated to ensure complete cleavage.)\n\n    Step 1.4: Post-Deblocking Wash\n\n        Option 1.4.1: Wash beads with 1X Binding & Washing (B&W) Buffer to remove deblocking agent.\n            - Component A: Beads from Step 1.3\n            - Component B: 1X B&W Buffer\n                - Recipe: 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl\n            (Operational details: Use a magnetic stand to separate the beads for 2 minutes. Remove the deblocking buffer. Add 1X B&W Buffer, resuspend the beads, separate, and discard the supernatant. Repeat wash cycles 2-3 times.)\n\n    Step 1.5: Subsequent Synthesis Cycles for ACTCTGAT\n\n        Option 1.5.1: Repeat steps 1.1 through 1.4 for the remaining 7 nucleotides.\n            (Operational details: For each cycle, perform the Coupling (Step 1.1), Post-Coupling Wash (Step 1.2), Deblocking (Step 1.3), and Post-Deblocking Wash (Step 1.4). The specific 3\u2032-ONH2-dNTP used in the coupling step is changed for each cycle according to the target sequence ACTCTGAT.)\n            - Cycle 2 (C): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dCTP.\n            - Cycle 3 (T): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dTTP.\n            - Cycle 4 (C): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dCTP.\n            - Cycle 5 (T): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dTTP.\n            - Cycle 6 (G): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dGTP.\n            - Cycle 7 (A): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dATP.\n            - Cycle 8 (T): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dTTP.\n\n---\nA list containing reagents whose availability has yet to be verified.\nReagent Check List:\n---\n1 M aqueous sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8\n The procedure has been saved to the file: Protocol-2c4d"}
