{"content": "I am using the `Protocol` agent to apply the optimization hypothesis saved in `Hypothesis-3eab` to the current best procedure, `Protocol-d28c`. This hypothesis suggests increasing the final concentration of the 3\u2032-ONH2-dNTP substrate (Component C) from 0.25 mM to 0.50 mM in Step 1.1 of the iterative synthesis. This is a common strategy to improve reaction kinetics and product yield in enzymatic synthesis by ensuring sufficient substrate is available for the enzyme. I am also providing the `manuals` that were collected in the process and setting `pure_software` to `False` and `retry` to `False` as this is a modification of an existing experimental procedure.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"pure_software": false, "manuals": ["beads-manual", "3-ONH2-dnTP-manual"], "experiment_name": "enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT", "file_ids": ["Protocol-d28c", "Hypothesis-3eab"], "retry": false}, "id": "afdb931c-eb9d-42c5-a077-0b4137194e54", "type": "tool_call"}]}
