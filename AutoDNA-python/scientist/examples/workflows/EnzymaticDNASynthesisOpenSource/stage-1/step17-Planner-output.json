{"content": "I am using the `Hypothesis` agent to generate an optimization hypothesis.\n- `current_optimize_target`: I am setting this to \"stepwise yield\" because the primary goal of this optimization cycle is to improve the stepwise yield of the DNA synthesis, as the current yield (94.07%) is below the acceptable threshold (97.713% of the SOTA yield of 98.7%).\n- `roll_back_num`: I am setting this to 0. This parameter indicates how many previous optimization attempts should be discarded. Since this is the very first optimization step after an initial run, there are no previous optimization attempts to roll back.\n- `current_procedure_id`: I am providing \"Protocol-b5fc\" as the ID of the current experimental procedure. This is the procedure that was executed and resulted in the 94.07% stepwise yield, and it's the one we aim to optimize.\n- `manuals`: I am including `beads-manual` and `3-ONH2-dnTP-manual` in the manuals list. These manuals were identified as relevant during the protocol generation and reagent check phases, and they might contain valuable information that could inform the optimization hypothesis.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Hypothesis", "args": {"manuals": ["beads-manual", "3-ONH2-dnTP-manual"], "current_procedure_id": "Protocol-b5fc", "roll_back_num": 0.0, "current_optimize_target": "stepwise yield"}, "id": "48395964-dac5-4125-ac4e-b00642c77837", "type": "tool_call"}]}
