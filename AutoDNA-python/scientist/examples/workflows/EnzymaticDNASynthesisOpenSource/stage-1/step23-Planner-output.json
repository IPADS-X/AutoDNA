I am calling the `Hardware` agent to execute the Python code for this experiment.\n\n- `file_ids`: I am passing `Code-483c`, which is the ID of the Python code script generated from the modified protocol (Protocol-1b1e). This protocol now includes the optimization advice to repeat the deblocking step.\n- `pure_software`: I am setting this to `False` because this is a wet-lab experiment involving hardware.\n- `repeat_num`: I am setting this to `4` as specified in the initial user request, to ensure the measured yield is more accurate.\n\nAfter this execution, I will evaluate the new stepwise yield and time, and decide if further optimization is needed.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Hardware", "args": {"pure_software": false, "file_ids": ["Code-483c"], "repeat_num": 4.0}, "id": "68c17740-0d16-4dc8-b6a2-66ecfa8c18f3", "type": "tool_call"}]}
