Repeat as necessary to equilibrate the beads.)\n\n    Step 1.2: Immobilization of the Initiator Oligonucleotide\n\n        Option 1.2.1: Bind 5\u2032-biotinylated oligonucleotide to streptavidin magnetic beads.\n            - Component A: Washed streptavidin magnetic beads (from Step 1.1)\n            - Component B: 5\u2032-biotinylated oligonucleotide (P2)\n            - Component C: lysis buffer\n                - Recipe: 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl\n            (Operational details: Incubate the beads with the 5\u2032-biotinylated oligonucleotide (P2) in lysis buffer to allow biotin-streptavidin binding. After incubation, wash the beads with lysis buffer to remove any unbound oligonucleotide. The final concentration of the immobilized oligonucleotides should be prepared for a working concentration of 1 \u03bcM in the subsequent coupling reaction.)\n\nPart 2: Iterative Synthesis of ACTCTGAT\n\n    Step 2.1: Coupling Reaction (First Nucleotide Addition: A)\n\n        Option 2.1.1: TdT-mediated incorporation of 3\u2032-ONH2-dATP.\n            - Component A: Immobilized 5\u2032-biotinylated oligonucleotide (P2) on streptavidin magnetic beads (at 1 \u00b5M final concentration)\n            - Component B: ZaTdT-R335L-K337G (at 1 mg/mL final concentration)\n            - Component C: 3\u2032-ONH2-dATP (at 0.25 mM final concentration)\n            - Component D: CoCl2 (at 0.25 mM final concentration)\n            - Component E: phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) (at 50 mM final concentration)\n            - Component F: NaCl (at 100 mM final concentration)\n            (Operational details: Combine all components and incubate the reaction mixture at 30 \u00b0C for 10 min.)\n\n    Step 2.2: Post-Coupling Wash\n\n        Option 2.2.1: Wash beads with lysis buffer.\n            - Component A: Beads from Step 2.1\n            - Component B: lysis buffer\n                - Recipe: 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl\n            (Operational details: Use a magnetic stand to separate the beads. Remove the supernatant containing the coupling reaction mixture. Add lysis buffer, resuspend the beads, separate, and discard the supernatant. Repeat wash cycles as needed.)\n\n    Step 2.3: Deblocking Reaction\n\n        Option 2.3.1: Cleavage of the 3\u2032-ONH2 protecting group using sodium nitrite.\n            - Component A: Washed beads from Step 2.2\n            - Component B: sodium nitrite buffer\n                - Recipe: 700 mM sodium nitrite, pH 5, adjusted with nitrous acid\n            (Operational details: Resuspend the beads in the sodium nitrite buffer and incubate to cleave the 3'-ONH2 group, generating a free 3'-OH group for the next synthesis cycle.)\n\n    Step 2.4: Post-Deblocking Wash\n\n        Option 2.4.1: Wash beads with lysis buffer to remove deblocking agent.\n            - Component A: Beads from Step 2.3\n            - Component B: lysis buffer\n                - Recipe: 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl\n            (Operational details: Use a magnetic stand to separate the beads. Remove the deblocking buffer. Add lysis buffer, resuspend the beads, separate, and discard the supernatant. This step is critical to neutralize the acidic deblocking buffer and prepare the beads for the next coupling reaction.)\n\n    Step 2.5: Subsequent Synthesis Cycles for ACTCTGAT\n\n        Option 2.5.1: Repeat steps 2.1 through 2.4 for the remaining 7 nucleotides.\n            (Operational details: For each cycle, perform the Coupling (Step 2.1), Post-Coupling Wash (Step 2.2), Deblocking (Step 2.3), and Post-Deblocking Wash (Step 2.4). The specific 3\u2032-ONH2-dNTP used in the coupling step (as in Option 2.1.1) is changed for each cycle according to the target sequence ACTCTGAT.)\n            - Cycle 2 (C): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dCTP.\n            - Cycle 3 (T): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dTTP.\n            - Cycle 4 (C): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dCTP.\n            - Cycle 5 (T): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dTTP.\n            - Cycle 6 (G): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dGTP.\n            - Cycle 7 (A): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dATP.\n            - Cycle 8 (T): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dTTP.\n\nPart 3: Post-Synthesis Purification\n\n    Step 3.1: Final Product Purification\n\n        Option 3.1.1: Purify the final bead-bound product using HPLC.\n            - Component A: Beads carrying the fully synthesized ACTCTGAT oligonucleotide (from Part 2).\n            (Operational details: The synthesized product on the magnetic beads is subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for purification and analysis.)\n\n---\nA list containing reagents whose availability has yet to be verified.\nReagent Check List:\n---\n5\u2032-biotinylated oligonucleotide (P2)\nstreptavidin magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-270 Streptavidin)\nImmobilized 5\u2032-biotinylated oligonucleotide (P2) on streptavidin magnetic beads\nZaTdT-R335L-K337G\n3\u2032-ONH2-dATP\n3\u2032-ONH2-dCTP\n3\u2032-ONH2-dTTP\n3\u2032-ONH2-dGTP\nCoCl2\nNaCl\npotassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8)\nphosphate buffer (pH 6.8)\nlysis buffer (components: potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), NaCl)\nsodium nitrite\nnitrous acid\nsodium nitrite buffer (components: sodium nitrite, nitrous acid)\nBeads carrying the fully synthesized ACTCTGAT oligonucleotide\n The procedure has been saved to the file: Protocol-d3b9"}
