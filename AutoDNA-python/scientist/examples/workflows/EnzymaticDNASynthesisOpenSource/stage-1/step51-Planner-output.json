{"content": "I will convert the updated experimental procedure, which incorporates the hypothesis of increasing CoCl2 concentration to improve stepwise yield, into executable Python code. This is done by calling the `Code` agent with `code_request_id` set to `Protocol-d4be`. This will generate the necessary scripts for the hardware. Then I will execute the generated Python code on the hardware by calling the `Hardware` agent with the `file_ids` of the generated code and `repeat_num` set to 4 to ensure accuracy. This will allow me to observe the impact of the increased CoCl2 concentration on the stepwise yield and time, and determine if it improves upon the previous best yield of 95.72%.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Code", "args": {"pure_software": false, "code_request_id": "Protocol-d4be"}, "id": "1299d9ac-8242-405a-ad20-a4ae25d20715", "type": "tool_call"}]}
