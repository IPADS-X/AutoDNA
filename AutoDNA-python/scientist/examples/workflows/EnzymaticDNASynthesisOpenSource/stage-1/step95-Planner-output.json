First, I used the `Literature` agent to find the state-of-the-art stepwise yield (98.7%) and a general procedure for the experiment.\n2. I then used the `Protocol` and `Reagent` agents to generate a validated experimental procedure based on available lab resources.\n3. The initial experiment was executed using the `Code` and `Hardware` agents, resulting in a stepwise yield of 94.07% and a time of 6h48min.\n4. The primary optimization goal was to improve the stepwise yield. I used the `Hypothesis` agent to generate several optimization hypotheses.\n5. After several iterations of generating hypotheses, modifying the protocol, and executing the experiment, the stepwise yield was successfully improved to 97.66%, which was within the 1% acceptable drop from the state-of-the-art yield. The successful optimizations included adding Tween-20 to the wash buffer, increasing the CoCl2 concentration, increasing the 3\u2032-ONH2-dNTP concentration, and increasing the enzyme concentration.\n6. With the yield at a satisfactory level, the optimization target was switched to minimizing time.\n7. Two successful time optimization iterations were performed, reducing the magnetic separation time and the coupling incubation time. This resulted in a procedure with a time of 5h20min and a stepwise yield of 97.76%, which still met the yield constraint.\n8. A final time optimization was attempted by reducing the number of wash cycles. This reduced the time to 4h48min but caused the stepwise yield to drop to 96.86%, which was below the minimum acceptable threshold of 97.7%.\n9. As the last optimization step violated the user-defined constraint, the optimization process was stopped. The best procedure was identified as the one from the previous step, which provided the shortest time while maintaining the required yield.\n### final_result ###\nPart 1: Iterative Synthesis of ACTCTGAT\n\n    Step 1.1: Coupling Reaction (First Nucleotide Addition: A)\n\n        Option 1.1.1: TdT-mediated incorporation of 3\u2032-ONH2-dATP in phosphate buffer.\n            - Component A: Immobilized initiator oligonucleotide on beads (at 1 \u00b5M final concentration)\n            - Component B: ZaTdT-R335L-K337G (at 2 mg/mL final concentration)\n            - Component C: 3\u2032-ONH2-dATP (at 0.50 mM final concentration, purified as in Part 2)\n            - Component D: CoCl2 (at 0.50 mM final concentration)\n            - Component E: phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) (at 50 mM final concentration)\n            - Component F: NaCl (at 100 mM final concentration)\n            (Operational details: Combine all components, ensuring they are prepared with HPLC-grade water and free from aldehyde/ketone contamination.
