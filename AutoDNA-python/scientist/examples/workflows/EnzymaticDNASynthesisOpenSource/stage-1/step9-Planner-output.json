{"content": "I will call the `Reagent` agent to check the availability of the reagents.\nMy reasoning for choosing this agent is that the previous step (`Protocol-ceca`) generated a new experimental procedure with several alternative options and, consequently, a new list of reagents. Before proceeding, I must verify which of these reagents are available in the lab's inventory. This will allow me to select the viable options from the procedure and move forward with the experiment.\n\nI will set the `reagent_query_id` param to `Protocol-ceca` because this file contains the most up-to-date list of reagents that need to be checked.\nI will leave the `gather_mode` param empty (defaults to `False`) as I need to check the availability of specific reagents, not get a summary of the entire inventory.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Reagent", "args": {"reagent_query_id": "Protocol-ceca"}, "id": "call_55cc081b9b8d43c5b097b5dae10564ba", "type": "tool_call"}]}
