{"content": "I will call the `Protocol` agent to generate an initial experimental procedure.\nMy reasoning for choosing this agent is that I need to create a detailed experimental plan based on the information I've gathered from the literature search. The `Protocol` agent is designed to generate such procedures.\n\nI will set the `experiment_name` param to `\"enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT\"` to reflect the experiment's goal.\nI will set the `file_ids` param to `[\"Literature-9736\"]` to provide the agent with the context from the literature search, including the SOTA yield and the general procedure.\nI will set `pure_software` to `False` as this is a wet lab experiment.\nI will leave the `retry` and `manuals` params empty as this is the first attempt and I don't have any manuals to provide at this stage.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"experiment_name": "enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT", "file_ids": ["Literature-9736"]}, "id": "call_e64cbd1f2b9a4c02b3a743b38a07935a", "type": "tool_call"}]}
