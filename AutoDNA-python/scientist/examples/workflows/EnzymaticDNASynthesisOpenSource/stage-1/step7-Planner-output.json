{"content": "I will call the `Protocol` agent to adjust the experimental procedure.\nMy reasoning for choosing this agent is that the previous reagent check revealed that some of the required reagents are unavailable or available in different forms (e.g., stock solutions, pre-mixed buffers). Therefore, the initial protocol needs to be modified to use the available materials. The `Protocol` agent is the appropriate tool for this task as it can refine an existing procedure based on new information.\n\nI will set the `experiment_name` param to `\"enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT\"`.\nI will set the `file_ids` param to `[\"Protocol-d3b9\", \"Reagent-4406\"]` to provide the agent with the original protocol and the results of the reagent check.\nI will set the `manuals` param to `[\"beads-manual\", \"3-ONH2-dnTP-manual\"]` to incorporate information from the available manuals into the revised procedure.\nI will set `pure_software` to `False` as this is a wet lab experiment.\nI will leave the `retry` param empty as I am adjusting the protocol based on available reagents, not retrying a failed procedure.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"experiment_name": "enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT", "file_ids": ["Protocol-d3b9", "Reagent-4406"], "manuals": ["beads-manual", "3-ONH2-dnTP-manual"]}, "id": "call_ad2138778c744f80ac8b28c6752f78aa", "type": "tool_call"}]}
