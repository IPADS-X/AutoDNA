{"content": "I will call the `Literature` agent to gather information about the experiment.\nMy reasoning for choosing this agent is that I need to find out what is the state-of-the-art stepwise yield for enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis and the general procedure.\n\nI will set the `questions` param to `['What is the state-of-the-art stepwise yield for enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis?', 'What is the general procedure for enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT?']` because I need to know the SOTA stepwise yield to set a baseline for the optimization and the general procedure to generate the initial protocol.\nI will set the `experiment_name` param to `enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT` because it's the high-level goal of the experiment.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Literature", "args": {"experiment_name": "enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT", "questions": ["What is the state-of-the-art stepwise yield for enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis?", "What is the general procedure for enzymatic de novo DNA synthesis of ACTCTGAT?"]}, "id": "call_702c5ba5fb22425f874d3633a2e1484b", "type": "tool_call"}]}
