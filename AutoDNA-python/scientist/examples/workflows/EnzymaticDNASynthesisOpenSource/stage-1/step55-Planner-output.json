{"content": "I will use the `Hypothesis` tool to generate an optimization advice for the current experimental procedure to further improve the \"stepwise yield\". The `current_procedure_id` will be set to `Protocol-d28c`, which is the ID of the procedure that resulted in the 96.23% stepwise yield. `roll_back_num` is 0 because the last optimization attempt was successful (it increased the yield). `manuals` will include `beads-manual` and `3-ONH2-dnTP-manual` to provide context to the hypothesis generation.\n\nMy reasoning for this choice is to continue the optimization process as the current stepwise yield of 96.23% is still below the target of 97.7% (98.7% SOTA - 1% allowable drop). The `Hypothesis` tool is designed to provide actionable advice for optimization based on previous results and available information.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Hypothesis", "args": {"manuals": ["beads-manual", "3-ONH2-dnTP-manual"], "current_procedure_id": "Protocol-d28c", "roll_back_num": 0.0, "current_optimize_target": "stepwise yield"}, "id": "de2b4081-1a59-4508-86f1-12b1968b957d", "type": "tool_call"}]}
