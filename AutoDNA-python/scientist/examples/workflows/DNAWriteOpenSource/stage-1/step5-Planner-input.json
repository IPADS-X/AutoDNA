This binary stream is then transformed into its ternary equivalent, which serves as the foundational data sequence for DNA encoding (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n2.  **Segmentation and Homopolymer Avoidance** The long ternary sequence is partitioned into smaller, manageable segments for storage. The conversion from these ternary digits (trits) to DNA bases is specifically designed to prevent homopolymers, which are consecutive runs of the same base, thereby reducing synthesis and sequencing errors (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n3.  **DNA Strand Structure** Each 8-base-long DNA strand is structured to include indexing trits, data trits, and an error correction trit (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n4.  **Error Correction Trit Calculation** The value for the error correction trit is calculated for each segment by summing the corresponding source trits (both index and data) and taking the result modulo 3 (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n5.  **Encoding Initialization** To ensure consistent encoding, the first base of every DNA strand is processed using a fixed initial condition: the preceding base is always treated as 'G'. Any necessary padding appears at the beginning (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n6.  **Ternary-to-Base Conversion Rules** The conversion from ternary digits to DNA bases follows specific rules that depend on the preceding base, as outlined in Table 1 (Encoding2025 pages 1-2):\n    *   If the previous base is A: Ternary 0 converts to T, 1 to C, 2 to G.\n    *   If the previous base is T: Ternary 0 converts to A, 1 to C, 2 to G.\n    *   If the previous base is C: Ternary 0 converts to A, 1 to T, 2 to G.\n    *   If the previous base is G: Ternary 0 converts to A, 1 to T, 2 to C.\n\n**Encoding the Sentence 'Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change'**:\n\nThe provided context outlines a methodology for encoding *digital data* into DNA sequences, starting with a binary stream (Encoding2025 pages 1-2). However, it does not specify the method or standard for converting a *text sentence* such as 'Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change' into a binary stream. Without this initial text-to-binary conversion protocol, it is not possible to proceed with the subsequent steps of ternary conversion, segmentation, and DNA base conversion as described in the methodology. Therefore, I cannot provide the DNA sequence for the given sentence.\n The information has been saved to the file: Literature-81c7", "================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: stage-1\n\nI have called the `Literature` agent to gather information on encoding text into DNA sequences.\n\n**Reasoning for choosing this agent:**\n\nThe first step in solving this problem is to understand the established methods for converting text into a DNA sequence. The `Literature` agent is the most appropriate tool for this purpose as it can search scientific literature and documents to find relevant protocols and methodologies.\n\n**Parameter filling:**\n\n- `questions`: I have provided two questions:\n    1.  `\"What are the methods for encoding text into DNA sequences?\"` - This is a broad question to understand the general principles and available techniques for text-to-DNA encoding.\n    2.  `\"How to encode the sentence 'Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change' into a DNA sequence?\"` - This is a specific question that directly addresses the user's requirement. I'm asking the agent to find a method and apply it to the given sentence.\n\n- `experiment_name`: I have set this to `\"DNA sequence encoding\"` to provide context for the search.\n\nThe agent's response indicates that while it found a method for converting binary data to a DNA sequence, it does not have information on how to convert the initial text sentence into a binary stream. This means we are missing a crucial first step. To address this, I will now use the `Protocol` agent to generate a complete procedure that includes this missing text-to-binary conversion step.\nTool Calls:\n  Protocol (47c7597d-297e-4ea0-b626-7d21c53794e3)\n Call ID: 47c7597d-297e-4ea0-b626-7d21c53794e3\n  Args:\n    experiment_name: DNA sequence encoding\n    file_ids: ['Literature-81c7']\n    pure_software: True", "================================= Tool Message =================================\nName: Protocol\n\nHere is a step-by-step algorithm to encode the given DNA sequence, designed to be easily translated into code.\n\nThis algorithm resolves the missing text-to-binary conversion step by adopting the standard ASCII-to-binary protocol. It also establishes a necessary structure for data and indexing trits to fulfill the requirements.\n\n### **Assumptions Made to Complete the Schema**\n\n1.  **Text to Binary Conversion:** The sentence will be converted to binary using the standard 8-bit ASCII representation for each character.\n2.  **Strand Structure:** To satisfy the requirement of including indexing and data trits within the 7 available \"source trits\" per strand, a split must be defined. Based on the amount of data generated, a viable structure is **4 trits for the index** and **3 trits for the data**. This allows for up to 3\u2074 = 81 unique strands, which is sufficient for the given sentence.\n\n---\n\n### **Algorithm: DNA Sequence Encoding**\n\n**Objective:** Encode the sentence 'Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change' into a series of 8-base DNA strands.\n\n**Input:**\n*   `Sentence` (String): \"Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change\"\n\n**Constants:**\n*   `DNA_MAP` (Dictionary/Map): The ternary-to-base conversion rules.\n    ```\n    {\n        'A': {'0': 'T', '1': 'C', '2': 'G'},\n        'T': {'0': 'A', '1': 'C', '2': 'G'},\n        'C': {'0': 'A', '1': 'T', '2': 'G'},\n        'G': {'0': 'A', '1': 'T', '2': 'C'}\n    }\n    ```\n*   `INDEX_TRIT_COUNT` (Integer): 4\n*   `DATA_TRIT_COUNT` (Integer): 3\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n#### **Part 1: Data Preparation (Text -> Binary -> Ternary)**\n\n1.  **Convert Sentence to a Single Binary Stream:**\n    a. Initialize an empty string `BinaryStream`.\n    b. For each character `c` in the `Sentence`:\n        i.  Get the ASCII integer value of `c`.\n        ii. Convert this integer into its 8-bit binary representation (e.g., 'I' (73) becomes \"01001001\").\n        iii. Append the 8-bit string to `BinaryStream`.\n    c. After iterating through all 46 characters, `BinaryStream` will be a single string of 368 bits.\n\n2.  **Convert Binary Stream to Ternary Stream:**\n    a. Treat `BinaryStream` as a representation of a single large integer. Convert this integer from base-2 to base-3.\n    b. Store the result as a string of ternary digits (trits), `TernaryDataStream`. (This will result in a stream of 233 trits).\n\n#### **Part 2: Segmentation and Structuring**\n\n3.  **Pad the Ternary Data Stream:**\n    a. Calculate the total number of strands required: `NumStrands = CEILING(LENGTH(TernaryDataStream) / DATA_TRIT_COUNT)`.\n    b. Calculate the required total length for the data: `PaddedLength = NumStrands * DATA_TRIT_COUNT`.\n    c. Add leading '0' trits to the beginning of `TernaryDataStream` until its length equals `PaddedLength`. This respects the \"padding appears at the beginning\" rule without changing the numerical value of the data.\n\n4.  **Generate Source Trit Segments:**\n    a. Initialize an empty list `SourceSegments`.\n    b. For each index `i` from `0` to `NumStrands - 1`:\n        i.  **Get Data Chunk:** Extract the `i`-th chunk of `DATA_TRIT_COUNT` trits from the `PaddedTernaryDataStream`.\n        ii. **Get Index Trits:** Convert the index `i` to its ternary representation. Add leading '0's until it is `INDEX_TRIT_COUNT` trits long.\n        iii. **Combine:** Concatenate the Index Trits and the Data Chunk to form a 7-trit `SourceSegment`.\n        iv. Add the `SourceSegment` to the `SourceSegments` list.\n\n#### **Part 3: Error Correction and DNA Conversion**\n\n5.  **Generate Final DNA Strands:**\n    a. Initialize an empty list `FinalDnaStrands`.\n    b. For each `SourceSegment` in the `SourceSegments` list:\n        i.  **Calculate Error Trit:**\n            1.  Sum the integer values of the 7 trits in the `SourceSegment`.\n            2.  Calculate the `ErrorTrit` as `Sum MOD 3`.\n        ii. **Form 8-Trit Strand:** Append the `ErrorTrit` to the end of the `SourceSegment` to create an `EightTritStrand`.\n        iii. **Convert to DNA:**\n            1.  Initialize `previous_base = 'G'`.\n            2.  Initialize an empty string `DnaStrand`.\n            3.  For each trit `t` in the `EightTritStrand`:\n                a. Find the corresponding `current_base` using `DNA_MAP[previous_base][t]`.\n                b. Append `current_base` to `DnaStrand`.\n                c. Update `previous_base = current_base`.\n        iv. Add the completed `DnaStrand` to the `FinalDnaStrands` list.\n\n**Output:**\n\n*   `FinalDnaStrands`: A list of 8-base-long DNA strings representing the encoded sentence.\n The algorithm has been saved to the file: Protocol-1b19"]}
