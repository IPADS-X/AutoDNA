{"content": "The method for encoding digital data into DNA sequences involves several steps to convert a binary stream into 8-base-long DNA strands, designed to prevent homopolymer formation and include error correction (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n\n**Encoding Methodology for Digital Data into DNA Sequences:**\n\n1.  **Data Conversion: Binary to Ternary** The source data is first converted into a single, long binary stream. This binary stream is then transformed into its ternary equivalent, which serves as the foundational data sequence for DNA encoding (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n2.  **Segmentation and Homopolymer Avoidance** The long ternary sequence is partitioned into smaller, manageable segments for storage. The conversion from these ternary digits (trits) to DNA bases is specifically designed to prevent homopolymers, which are consecutive runs of the same base, thereby reducing synthesis and sequencing errors (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n3.  **DNA Strand Structure** Each 8-base-long DNA strand is structured to include indexing trits, data trits, and an error correction trit (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n4.  **Error Correction Trit Calculation** The value for the error correction trit is calculated for each segment by summing the corresponding source trits (both index and data) and taking the result modulo 3 (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n5.  **Encoding Initialization** To ensure consistent encoding, the first base of every DNA strand is processed using a fixed initial condition: the preceding base is always treated as 'G'. Any necessary padding appears at the beginning (Encoding2025 pages 1-2).\n6.  **Ternary-to-Base Conversion Rules** The conversion from ternary digits to DNA bases follows specific rules that depend on the preceding base, as outlined in Table 1 (Encoding2025 pages 1-2):\n    *   If the previous base is A: Ternary 0 converts to T, 1 to C, 2 to G.\n    *   If the previous base is T: Ternary 0 converts to A, 1 to C, 2 to G.\n    *   If the previous base is C: Ternary 0 converts to A, 1 to T, 2 to G.\n    *   If the previous base is G: Ternary 0 converts to A, 1 to T, 2 to C.\n\n**Encoding the Sentence 'Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change'**:\n\nThe provided context outlines a methodology for encoding *digital data* into DNA sequences, starting with a binary stream (Encoding2025 pages 1-2). However, it does not specify the method or standard for converting a *text sentence* such as 'Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change' into a binary stream. Without this initial text-to-binary conversion protocol, it is not possible to proceed with the subsequent steps of ternary conversion, segmentation, and DNA base conversion as described in the methodology. Therefore, I cannot provide the DNA sequence for the given sentence.\n The information has been saved to the file: Literature-81c7"}
