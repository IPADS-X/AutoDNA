{"content": "I have called the `Literature` agent to gather information on encoding text into DNA sequences.\n\n**Reasoning for choosing this agent:**\n\nThe first step in solving this problem is to understand the established methods for converting text into a DNA sequence. The `Literature` agent is the most appropriate tool for this purpose as it can search scientific literature and documents to find relevant protocols and methodologies.\n\n**Parameter filling:**\n\n- `questions`: I have provided two questions:\n    1.  `\"What are the methods for encoding text into DNA sequences?\"` - This is a broad question to understand the general principles and available techniques for text-to-DNA encoding.\n    2.  `\"How to encode the sentence 'Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change' into a DNA sequence?\"` - This is a specific question that directly addresses the user's requirement. I'm asking the agent to find a method and apply it to the given sentence.\n\n- `experiment_name`: I have set this to `\"DNA sequence encoding\"` to provide context for the search.\n\nThe agent's response indicates that while it found a method for converting binary data to a DNA sequence, it does not have information on how to convert the initial text sentence into a binary stream. This means we are missing a crucial first step. To address this, I will now use the `Protocol` agent to generate a complete procedure that includes this missing text-to-binary conversion step.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"experiment_name": "DNA sequence encoding", "file_ids": ["Literature-81c7"], "pure_software": true}, "id": "47c7597d-297e-4ea0-b626-7d21c53794e3", "type": "tool_call"}]}
