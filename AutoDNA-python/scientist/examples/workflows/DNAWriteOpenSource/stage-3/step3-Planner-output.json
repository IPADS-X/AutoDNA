This step is crucial to translate the information gathered from the literature into a structured, step-by-step plan that can be executed in the lab.\n\nI have set the `experiment_name` parameter to \"DNA sample purification\" to ensure the generated protocol is tailored to the user's specific goal. I have also passed the file ID from the previous literature search (\"Literature-7517\") to the `file_ids` parameter. This will provide the agent with the necessary information to construct a scientifically sound and well-documented protocol based on the established methods. I am not filling in any other parameters because they are not relevant to this task.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"experiment_name": "DNA sample purification", "file_ids": ["Literature-7517"]}, "id": "call_3d0689f6988f49c6aa78b1c2f4d64c66", "type": "tool_call"}]}
