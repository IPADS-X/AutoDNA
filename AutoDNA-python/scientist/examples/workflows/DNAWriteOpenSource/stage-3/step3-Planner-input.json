Poly(A) Tailing** (Preparation2025 page 1)\n1.  Place the synthesized DNA tube on a magnetic rack and remove the supernatant (Preparation2025 page 1).\n2.  A 50 \u00b5l reaction mixture is prepared by adding the following components to the beads: 5 \u00b5l of 10X TdT buffer, 5 \u00b5l of 2.5 mM CoCl\u2082, 0.5 \u00b5l of 10 mM dATP, 0.5 \u00b5l of TdT enzyme, and 39 \u00b5l of nuclease-free water (Preparation2025 page 1).\n3.  The reaction is incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C, then stopped by incubating at 65\u00b0C for 10 minutes. Agitation may be employed to enhance reaction efficiency (Preparation2025 page 1).\n4.  Following the Poly(A) tailing reaction, the beads are washed with 200 \u00b5l of water. This involves adding 200 \u00b5l of water and mixing thoroughly by pipetting, placing the tube on a magnetic rack for 2 minutes, aspirating and discarding the supernatant, and then removing the tube from the magnetic rack (Preparation2025 page 1).\n5.  These washing steps are repeated two additional times, for a total of three washes (Preparation2025 page 1).\n\n**II. Amplification** (Preparation2025 page 1)\n1.  A 50 \u00b5l reaction mixture for the first Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is prepared by adding 25 \u00b5l of 2x Phanta Max Master Mix, 2 \u00b5l of 10 \u00b5M PolyT primer, and 23 \u00b5l of nuclease-free water to the tube containing the tailed beads (Preparation2025 page 1).\n2.  The first PCR is performed using the following thermal cycling program: 95\u00b0C for 3 minutes, followed by 10 cycles of (95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 65\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds), a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes, and a hold at 4\u00b0C (Preparation2025 page 1).\n3.  After the first PCR, the tube is placed on a magnetic rack for 2 minutes, and the supernatant is collected. A 50 \u00b5l reaction mixture for the second PCR is then prepared using 20 \u00b5l of the collected supernatant, 2 \u00b5l of 10 \u00b5M P5 primer, 2 \u00b5l of 10 \u00b5M P7-i23 primer, and 26 \u00b5l of nuclease-free water (Preparation2025 page 1).\n4.  The second PCR is performed with the following program: 95\u00b0C for 3 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of (95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 65\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds), a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes, and a hold at 4\u00b0C (Preparation2025 page 1).\n5.  After the second PCR, the tube is placed on a magnetic rack for 2 minutes, and the entire supernatant is transferred to a new tube (Preparation2025 page 1).\n\n**III. Purification** (Preparation2025 page 2)\n1.  To the supernatant obtained from the final PCR step, 110 \u00b5l of Vazyme VAHTS DNA Clean Beads are added and mixed thoroughly by pipetting 30 times (Preparation2025 page 2).\n2.  The mixture is incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes to facilitate DNA binding to the beads (Preparation2025 page 2).\n3.  The sample is placed on a magnetic rack and allowed to clear for approximately 5 minutes, after which the supernatant is carefully removed and discarded (Preparation2025 page 2).\n4.  While the sample remains on the magnetic rack, 200 \u00b5l of freshly prepared 80% ethanol is added to wash the beads. The sample is incubated at room temperature for 30 seconds, then the supernatant is carefully removed and discarded (Preparation2025 page 2).\n5.  This ethanol washing step (step 4) is repeated once more, for a total of two ethanol washes (Preparation2025 page 2).\n6.  The beads are air-dried for 7 minutes at room temperature while remaining on the magnetic rack (Preparation2025 page 2).\n7.  The tube is removed from the magnetic rack, and an appropriate volume of nuclease-free water is added. The beads are thoroughly resuspended by vortexing or pipetting and allowed to stand for 2 minutes at room temperature. The tube is then placed back on the magnetic rack for 5 minutes until the solution clears. The supernatant, containing the purified DNA, is carefully transferred to a new nuclease-free tube (Preparation2025 page 2).\n The information has been saved to the file: Literature-7517"]}
