This is a crucial quality control step to ensure that the protocol is viable and can be executed with the available lab resources.\n\nI have set the `experiment_name` parameter to \"DNA sample purification\" to maintain the context of the experiment. I have also provided a list of file IDs to the `file_ids` parameter, which includes both the protocol file (\"Protocol-b8fc\") and the reagent availability file (\"Reagent-4fac\"). By cross-referencing these two files, the agent can confirm that all the necessary reagents are available and that the protocol can proceed as planned.
