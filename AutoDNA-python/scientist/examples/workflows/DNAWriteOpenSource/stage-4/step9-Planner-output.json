{"content": "I will call the `Code` agent.\nThe reason for choosing this agent is that the user wants to execute the experiment, which requires generating python code from the given protocol first.\n- `code_request_id`: I will fill in this parameter with the file id of the protocol I just generated, which is \"Protocol-355c\". This is because this file contains all the necessary information for the code generation.\n- `pure_software`: I will set this parameter to `False`. This is because the experiment involves moving the DNA samples to the refrigerator, which is a physical action and not a pure software task.\n- `multiple_inputs`: I will leave this parameter empty. This is because there are no multiple inputs required for this experiment.\n- `inputs_from_previous_stage`: I will fill in this parameter with all the container names of the final DNA products from the previous stage. This is because these containers are the inputs for the current stage.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Code", "args": {"pure_software": false, "inputs_from_previous_stage": "final_dna_product_synthesis_ATATATCT,final_dna_product_synthesis_ATACATCG,final_dna_product_synthesis_ATAGTACT,final_dna_product_synthesis_ATCATGCG,final_dna_product_synthesis_ATCTATGT,final_dna_product_synthesis_ATCGATCT,final_dna_product_synthesis_ATGATACA,final_dna_product_synthesis_ATGTACAC,final_dna_product_synthesis_ATGCATCG,final_dna_product_synthesis_ACATGATA,final_dna_product_synthesis_ACACGAGA,final_dna_product_synthesis_ACAGAGAG,final_dna_product_synthesis_ACTATACA,final_dna_product_synthesis_ACTCTGAT,final_dna_product_synthesis_ACTGAGCG,final_dna_product_synthesis_ACGAGTGC,final_dna_product_synthesis_ACGTAGCG,final_dna_product_synthesis_ACGCGATC,final_dna_product_synthesis_AGATCTAC,final_dna_product_synthesis_AGACTATC,final_dna_product_synthesis_AGAGACAG,final_dna_product_synthesis_AGTATGAG,final_dna_product_synthesis_AGTCATGA,final_dna_product_synthesis_AGTGCGCG,final_dna_product_synthesis_AGCACGAC,final_dna_product_synthesis_AGCTCGAG,final_dna_product_synthesis_AGCGATCT,final_dna_product_synthesis_TATACATG,final_dna_product_synthesis_TATCTCAC,final_dna_product_synthesis_TATGATAT,final_dna_product_synthesis_TACAGAGA,final_dna_product_synthesis_TACTATAT,final_dna_product_synthesis_TACGTATG,final_dna_product_synthesis_TAGATCGA,final_dna_product_synthesis_TAGTGATA,final_dna_product_synthesis_TAGCTCAC,final_dna_product_synthesis_TCATGCGC,final_dna_product_synthesis_TCACTAGA,final_dna_product_synthesis_TCAGATAC,final_dna_product_synthesis_TCTACTGT,final_dna_product_synthesis_TCTCGAGC,final_dna_product_synthesis_TCTGTAGC,final_dna_product_synthesis_TCGACTGC,final_dna_product_synthesis_TCGTAGTG,final_dna_product_synthesis_TCGCGTGC,final_dna_product_synthesis_TGATCGCG,final_dna_product_synthesis_TGACTCAT,final_dna_product_synthesis_TGAGAGTG,final_dna_product_synthesis_TGTAGCAG,final_dna_product_synthesis_TGTCGCTC,final_dna_product_synthesis_TGTGCGTG,final_dna_product_synthesis_TGCATATG,final_dna_product_synthesis_TGCTCAGA,final_dna_product_synthesis_TGCGTCGC,final_dna_product_synthesis_CATAGTAG,final_dna_product_synthesis_CATCGTCT,final_dna_product_synthesis_CATGCGAG,final_dna_product_synthesis_CACAGATG,final_dna_product_synthesis_CACTAGAT,final_dna_product_synthesis_CACGATCA,final_dna_product_synthesis_CAGATAGA,final_dna_product_synthesis_CAGTACTC,final_dna_product_synthesis_CAGCGCAC,final_dna_product_synthesis_CTATAGCT,final_dna_product_synthesis_CTACATAC,final_dna_product_synthesis_CTAGATGT,final_dna_product_synthesis_CTCAGCTA,final_dna_product_synthesis_CTCTACAT,final_dna_product_synthesis_CTCGTACG,final_dna_product_synthesis_CTGACATA,final_dna_product_synthesis_CTGTACAC,final_dna_product_synthesis_CTGCGTGA,final_dna_product_synthesis_CGATGATA,final_dna_product_synthesis_CGACGACG,final_dna_product_synthesis_CGAGTCTA,final_dna_product_synthesis_CGTAGAGA,final_dna_product_synthesis_CGTCACAC,final_dna_product_synthesis_CGTGTAGT", "code_request_id": "Protocol-355c"}, "id": "0d385348-4020-40e1-a0bb-a384bea18231", "type": "tool_call"}]}
