{"content": "I have tried to generate a protocol for your experiment, but it failed because too many reagents are not available in the lab. I will now try to generate a new protocol that only uses the available reagents. I will set the `retry` parameter to `True` to indicate that this is a second attempt to generate a valid protocol. I will also provide the previous reagent check result to the agent so that it knows which reagents are available. This will help the agent to generate a protocol that is more likely to be successful.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"file_ids": ["Reagent-4df8"], "experiment_name": "DNA sample storage at 4 degrees Celsius", "retry": true}, "id": "4e6276c6-a0b0-4c9b-bb5d-013f41a891f2", "type": "tool_call"}]}
