celsius.\n---\n\nPlease focus ONLY on executing this current stage.", "================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: stage-4\n\nI will now generate a protocol to store the final DNA samples in the refrigerator at 4 degrees Celsius. For this, I will use the **Protocol** agent.\n\nThe `experiment_name` parameter will be set to \"DNA sample storage\" to reflect the current goal. The `file_ids` parameter will be populated with the file ID from the previous stage, which contains the list of all the DNA products. This is crucial as it provides the protocol with the specific container names that need to be stored. All other parameters will be left at their default values since they are not relevant to this straightforward storage task.\nTool Calls:\n  Protocol (call_adf1f80c09fb4f359230c94a4d81eeef)\n Call ID: call_adf1f80c09fb4f359230c94a4d81eeef\n  Args:\n    experiment_name: DNA sample storage\n    file_ids: ['6b56ba3a-5349-4a47-a4af-7aa3b5f0f354']", "================================= Tool Message =================================\nName: Protocol\n\nPart 1: DNA Sample Preparation and Quantification\n\n    Step 1.1: Assess initial DNA quantity and quality.\n\n        Option 1.1.1: Quantification and purity assessment using UV-Vis Spectrophotometry.\n            - Component A: Purified DNA Sample\n            - Component B: Nuclease-free water\n            (operational details: Use a spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop). Blank the instrument with Nuclease-free water. Measure 1-2 \u00b5L of the purified DNA sample. Record the concentration (ng/\u00b5L) and purity ratios (A260/A280 and A260/A230). An A260/A280 ratio of ~1.8 is considered pure for DNA.)\n\n        Option 1.1.2: Quantification using Fluorometry.\n            - Component A: Purified DNA Sample\n            - Component B: Fluorometric quantification kit (e.g., Qubit dsDNA BR or HS Assay Kit)\n                - Recipe: Prepare the working solution by diluting the fluorescent dye in the provided buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n            (operational details: Use a fluorometer (e.g., Qubit). Prepare standards and samples as per the kit's instructions. This method is more specific for double-stranded DNA and is less affected by RNA contamination.)\n\n    Step 1.2: Normalize DNA concentration for consistent storage.\n\n        Option 1.2.1: Dilution with Nuclease-free water.\n            - Component A: Purified DNA Sample\n            - Component B: Nuclease-free water\n            (operational details: Based on the concentration measured in Step 1.1, calculate the volume of Nuclease-free water needed to dilute each DNA sample to a desired final concentration (e.g., 50 ng/\u00b5L). Add the calculated volume of water to the DNA sample and mix gently by pipetting or brief vortexing.)\n\n        Option 1.2.2: Dilution with TE Buffer.\n            - Component A: Purified DNA Sample\n            - Component B: TE Buffer (pH 8.0)\n                - Recipe: 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), in Nuclease-free water.\n            (operational details: Based on the concentration measured in Step 1.1, calculate the volume of TE Buffer needed to dilute each DNA sample to a desired final concentration. Add the calculated volume of TE Buffer to the DNA sample and mix gently.)\n\nPart 2: Preparing DNA Aliquots for Storage\n\n    Step 2.1: Select the storage medium for the DNA sample.\n\n        Option 2.1.1: Resuspend or maintain DNA in Nuclease-free water.\n            - Component A: Normalized DNA Sample\n            - Component B: Nuclease-free water\n            (operational details: If the DNA is already in nuclease-free water from Step 1.2.1, no further action is needed. If the DNA is a dry pellet, resuspend it in an appropriate volume of nuclease-free water to achieve the target concentration. This medium is suitable for immediate downstream applications but offers minimal protection against degradation.)\n\n        Option 2.1.2: Resuspend or buffer DNA in standard TE Buffer (pH 8.0).\n            - Component A: Normalized DNA Sample\n            - Component B: TE Buffer (pH 8.0)\n                - Recipe: 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), in Nuclease-free water.\n            (operational details: If the DNA is already in TE buffer from Step 1.2.2, no further action is needed. If the DNA is in water or a dry pellet, add or resuspend in TE Buffer. Tris buffers the pH, and EDTA chelates divalent cations, inhibiting nuclease activity, making this ideal for long-term storage.)\n\n        Option 2.1.3: Resuspend or buffer DNA in Low-EDTA TE Buffer (pH 8.0).\n            - Component A: Normalized DNA Sample\n            - Component B: Low-EDTA TE Buffer (pH 8.0)\n                - Recipe: 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), in Nuclease-free water.\n            (operational details: Use this buffer for DNA samples intended for downstream applications sensitive to high concentrations of EDTA, such as PCR or enzymatic reactions. Add or resuspend the DNA in this buffer.)\n\n        Option 2.1.4: Resuspend or buffer DNA in Tris-HCl Buffer (pH 8.0).\n            - Component A: Normalized DNA Sample\n            - Component B: Tris-HCl Buffer (pH 8.0)\n                - Recipe: 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in Nuclease-free water.\n            (operational details: Use this buffer when any amount of EDTA is undesirable. This option provides pH stability but lacks the nuclease-inhibiting properties of EDTA. Add or resuspend the DNA in this buffer.)\n\n    Step 2.2: Aliquot the DNA sample for storage.\n        (operational details: Dispense the DNA sample, prepared in its chosen storage medium from Step 2.1, into multiple, small-volume, sterile, nuclease-free microcentrifuge tubes. Typical aliquot volumes are 10-20 \u00b5L. This practice prevents repeated freeze-thaw cycles of the entire stock. Label each aliquot tube clearly with the sample name, concentration, and date.)\n\nPart 3: Storing the DNA Sample\n\n    Step 3.1: Store DNA in an aqueous state at various temperatures.\n\n        Option 3.1.1: Short-term storage at 4\u00b0C.\n            (operational details: Place the labeled DNA aliquots in a refrigerator at 4\u00b0C. This temperature is suitable for storage for a period of up to several weeks. It is not recommended for long-term preservation due to the potential for nuclease activity and DNA degradation.)\n\n        Option 3.1.2: Medium-term storage at -20\u00b0C.\n            (operational details: Place the labeled DNA aliquots in a standard laboratory freezer at -20\u00b0C. This is a common method for storing DNA for months to several years. Ensure the freezer is not a \"frost-free\" model, as the temperature cycles in such units can damage DNA.)\n\n        Option 3.1.3: Long-term archival storage at -80\u00b0C.\n            (operational details: Place the labeled DNA aliquots in an ultra-low temperature freezer at -80\u00b0C. This is the preferred method for archival storage of valuable DNA samples for many years, as it significantly slows down chemical degradation processes.)\n\n    Step 3.2: Store DNA in a precipitated state.\n\n        Option 3.2.1: Long-term storage as an ethanol precipitate.\n            - Component A: DNA in aqueous solution (e.g., TE buffer or water)\n            - Component B: 3 M Sodium Acetate (pH 5.2)\n            - Component C: 100% Ethanol (ice-cold)\n            (operational details: To the DNA sample, add 1/10th volume of 3 M Sodium Acetate and mix. Add 2.5 volumes of ice-cold 100% Ethanol. Mix by inversion until the DNA precipitate is visible. Centrifuge at >12,000 x g for 15-30 minutes at 4\u00b0C to pellet the DNA. Carefully remove the supernatant. Add 500 \u00b5L of 70% ethanol to wash the pellet. Centrifuge for 5 minutes. Remove the supernatant. Store the DNA pellet under 70% ethanol or as a dried pellet at -20\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C. This method provides excellent stability.)\n\nPart 4: Post-Storage Quality Control\n\n    Step 4.1: Retrieve and prepare the stored sample for analysis.\n        (operational details: For frozen samples, retrieve one aliquot per sample and thaw on ice. Briefly centrifuge the tube to collect the contents at the bottom. For ethanol precipitates, carefully aspirate the ethanol, air-dry the pellet for 5-10 minutes at room temperature, and resuspend in a desired buffer (e.g., TE Buffer or Nuclease-free water).)\n\n    Step 4.2: Assess DNA integrity after storage.\n\n        Option 4.2.1: Analysis by Agarose Gel Electrophoresis.\n            - Component A: Resuspended DNA Sample\n            - Component B: Agarose\n            - Component C: Gel running buffer (e.g., 1X TAE or 1X TBE)\n                - Recipe: (for 50X TAE stock): 242 g Tris base, 57.1 mL glacial acetic acid, 100 mL 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0), add water to 1 L. (for 5X TBE stock): 54 g Tris base, 27.5 g boric acid, 20 mL 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0), add water to 1 L.\n            - Component D: DNA ladder (molecular weight marker)\n            - Component E: 6X DNA Loading Dye\n            - Component F: DNA stain (e.g., Ethidium Bromide or SYBR Safe)\n            (operational details: Prepare a 0.8-1.2% agarose gel using the gel running buffer. Mix a known amount of DNA with loading dye and load it into the gel alongside a DNA ladder. Run the gel at 80-120V until the dye front has migrated sufficiently. Visualize the DNA under UV or blue light. Intact, high molecular weight genomic DNA should appear as a sharp band near the top of the gel. Degradation will appear as a smear of lower molecular weight fragments.)\n\n    Step 4.3: Assess DNA functionality after storage.\n\n        Option 4.3.1: Performance in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).\n            - Component A: Resuspended DNA Sample (as template)\n            - Component B: PCR Master Mix (contains Taq polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2, and reaction buffer)\n            - Component C: Forward Primer\n            - Component D: Reverse Primer\n            - Component E: Nuclease-free water\n            (operational details: Set up a standard PCR reaction using a small amount (10-100 ng) of the stored DNA as a template. Include appropriate positive and negative controls. Run the reaction on a thermal cycler with a validated amplification protocol. Analyze the PCR product on an agarose gel (as in Option 4.2.1). Successful amplification of the target band indicates that the DNA is functionally intact.)\n\n---\nA list containing reagents whose availability has yet to be verified.\nReagent Check List:\n---\n100% Ethanol\n3 M Sodium Acetate (pH 5.2)\n6X DNA Loading Dye\n70% Ethanol\nAcetic acid\nAgarose\nBoric acid\nDNA ladder\nDNA loading dye\nDNA stain\nEDTA\nEthanol\nFluorometric quantification kit\nForward Primer\nHydrochloric acid (HCl)\nLow-EDTA TE Buffer (pH 8.0) (components: Tris-HCl, EDTA, Nuclease-free water)\nNuclease-free water\nNormalized DNA Sample\nPCR Master Mix\nPurified DNA Sample\nResuspended DNA Sample\nReverse Primer\nSodium Acetate\nTAE Buffer (components: Tris base, Acetic acid, EDTA, Nuclease-free water)\nTBE Buffer (components: Tris base, Boric acid, EDTA, Nuclease-free water)\nTE Buffer (pH 8.0) (components: Tris-HCl, EDTA, Nuclease-free water)\nTris base\nTris-HCl\nTris-HCl Buffer (pH 8.0) (components: Tris-HCl, Nuclease-free water)\n The procedure has been saved to the file: Protocol-a582", "================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: stage-4\n\nI will now check the availability of the reagents listed in the generated protocol.

The procedure has been saved to the file: Protocol-dab9", "================================== Ai Message ==================================\nName: stage-4\n\nI will now generate the Python code for the validated experimental procedure. For this, I will use the **Code** agent.\n\nThe `code_request_id` parameter will be set to the file ID of the most recently generated protocol, \"Protocol-dab9\". This protocol is the one that was successfully validated and aligns with the user's direct request for simple storage. The `pure_software` parameter is set to `False` because this is not a purely software-based task. The `multiple_inputs` parameter is populated with the list of all the DNA product containers from the previous stage. This is because the protocol needs to be executed on each of these individual samples. Since `multiple_inputs` is specified, the `inputs_from_previous_stage` parameter is left empty.\nTool Calls:\n  Code (call_af48ee0147344cd4aa952b8e9cbabb80)\n Call ID: call_af48ee0147344cd4aa952b8e9cbabb80\n  Args:\n    code_request_id: Protocol-dab9\n    multiple_inputs: final_dna_product_synthesis_ATATATCT, final_dna_product_synthesis_ATACATCG, final_dna_product_synthesis_ATAGTACT, final_dna_product_synthesis_ATCATGCG, final_dna_product_synthesis_ATCTATGT, final_dna_product_synthesis_ATCGATCT, final_dna_product_synthesis_ATGATACA, final_dna_product_synthesis_ATGTACAC, final_dna_product_synthesis_ATGCATCG, final_dna_product_synthesis_ACATGATA, final_dna_product_synthesis_ACACGAGA, final_dna_product_synthesis_ACAGAGAG, final_dna_product_synthesis_ACTATACA, final_dna_product_synthesis_ACTCTGAT, final_dna_product_synthesis_ACTGAGCG, final_dna_product_synthesis_ACGAGTGC, final_dna_product_synthesis_ACGTAGCG, final_dna_product_synthesis_ACGCGATC, final_dna_product_synthesis_AGATCTAC, final_dna_product_synthesis_AGACTATC, final_dna_product_synthesis_AGAGACAG, final_dna_product_synthesis_AGTATGAG, final_dna_product_synthesis_AGTCATGA, final_dna_product_synthesis_AGTGCGCG, final_dna_product_synthesis_AGCACGAC, final_dna_product_synthesis_AGCTCGAG, final_dna_product_synthesis_AGCGATCT, final_dna_product_synthesis_TATACATG, final_dna_product_synthesis_TATCTCAC, final_dna_product_synthesis_TATGATAT, final_dna_product_synthesis_TACAGAGA, final_dna_product_synthesis_TACTATAT, final_dna_product_synthesis_TACGTATG, final_dna_product_synthesis_TAGATCGA, final_dna_product_synthesis_TAGTGATA, final_dna_product_synthesis_TAGCTCAC, final_dna_product_synthesis_TCATGCGC, final_dna_product_synthesis_TCACTAGA, final_dna_product_synthesis_TCAGATAC, final_dna_product_synthesis_TCTACTGT, final_dna_product_synthesis_TCTCGAGC, final_dna_product_synthesis_TCTGTAGC, final_dna_product_synthesis_TCGACTGC, final_dna_product_synthesis_TCGTAGTG, final_dna_product_synthesis_TCGCGTGC, final_dna_product_synthesis_TGATCGCG, final_dna_product_synthesis_TGACTCAT, final_dna_product_synthesis_TGAGAGTG, final_dna_product_synthesis_TGTAGCAG, final_dna_product_synthesis_TGTCGCTC, final_dna_product_synthesis_TGTGCGTG, final_dna_product_synthesis_TGCATATG, final_dna_product_synthesis_TGCTCAGA, final_dna_product_synthesis_TGCGTCGC, final_dna_product_synthesis_CATAGTAG, final_dna_product_synthesis_CATCGTCT, final_dna_product_synthesis_CATGCGAG, final_dna_product_synthesis_CACAGATG, final_dna_product_synthesis_CACTAGAT, final_dna_product_synthesis_CACGATCA, final_dna_product_synthesis_CAGATAGA, final_dna_product_synthesis_CAGTACTC, final_dna_product_synthesis_CAGCGCAC, final_dna_product_synthesis_CTATAGCT, final_dna_product_synthesis_CTACATAC, final_dna_product_synthesis_CTAGATGT, final_dna_product_synthesis_CTCAGCTA, final_dna_product_synthesis_CTCTACAT, final_dna_product_synthesis_CTCGTACG, final_dna_product_synthesis_CTGACATA, final_dna_product_synthesis_CTGTACAC, final_dna_product_synthesis_CTGCGTGA, final_dna_product_synthesis_CGATGATA, final_dna_product_synthesis_CGACGACG, final_dna_product_synthesis_CGAGTCTA, final_dna_product_synthesis_CGTAGAGA, final_dna_product_synthesis_CGTCACAC, final_dna_product_synthesis_CGTGTAGT\n    pure_software: False", "================================= Tool Message =================================\nName: Code\n\nresult: Code-a463"]}
