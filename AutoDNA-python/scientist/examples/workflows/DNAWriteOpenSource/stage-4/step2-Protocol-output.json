Prepare a master mix for each condition to ensure uniformity. Dispense the final mix into multiple, clearly labeled, sterile, nuclease-free microcentrifuge tubes (e.g., 20 \u00b5L per tube). Create enough aliquots per condition to cover all planned time points, plus extras. For example, for 5 time points, create at least 6 aliquots for each storage condition.)\n\nPart 2: Baseline Quality Assessment (Timepoint 0)\n\n    Step 2.1: Assess initial DNA concentration and purity.\n        (Operational details: Use one freshly prepared aliquot from each storage condition created in Step 1.2 for this baseline analysis.)\n\n        Option 2.1.1: Analysis via UV-Vis Spectrophotometry.\n            - Component A: DNA aliquot (in its respective storage solution)\n            - Component B: Blanking Solution (the corresponding storage solution without DNA)\n            (Operational details: Use a spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop).
