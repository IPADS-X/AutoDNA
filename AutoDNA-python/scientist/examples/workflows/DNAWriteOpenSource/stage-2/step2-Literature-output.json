{"content": "DNA synthesis is the process by which deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules are created, either *de novo* through chemical or enzymatic methods, or biologically through replication and repair mechanisms.\n\n### De Novo DNA Synthesis Methods\n\n**Enzymatic DNA Synthesis (TdT-mediated)**\nThis template-free enzymatic approach utilizes Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) for stepwise nucleotide addition (Lu2022 pages 1-2).\n\n1.  **Coupling Reaction (Nucleotide Addition)**:\n    *   **Components**:\n        *   Immobilized initiator oligonucleotide on beads (1 \u00b5M final concentration) (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n        *   ZaTdT-R335L-K337G (2 mg/mL final concentration), an engineered TdT from *Zonotrichia albicollis* (Lu2022 pages 1-2, Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n        *   3\u2032-ONH2-dATP (0.50 mM final concentration), a 3\u2032-O-blocked reversible nucleotide terminator, purified as in Part 2 (Lu2022 pages 1-2, Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n        *   CoCl2 (0.50 mM final concentration) (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n        *   Phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) (50 mM final concentration) (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n        *   NaCl (100 mM final concentration) (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n    *   **Operational Details**: All components are prepared with HPLC-grade water and are free from aldehyde/ketone contamination. The reaction mixture is incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 5 minutes with gentle tilting and rotation to keep beads suspended (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n2.  **Post-Coupling Wash**:\n    *   **Option 1.2.1**: Wash beads with 1X Binding & Washing (B&W) Buffer.\n        *   **Components**: Beads from the coupling step and 1X B&W Buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n    *   **Operational Details**: A magnetic stand is used to separate the beads for 1 minute, and the supernatant is removed. 1X B&W Buffer is added, beads are resuspended, separated, and the supernatant is discarded. This wash cycle is repeated 2-3 times (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n3.  **Deblocking Reaction**:\n    *   **Option 1.3.1**: Cleavage of the 3\u2032-ONH2 protecting group using sodium nitrite in acetate buffer.\n        *   **Components**: Washed beads from the post-coupling wash and Cleavage Reagent (700 mM NaNO2 in 1 M aqueous sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5) (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n    *   **Operational Details**: Beads are resuspended in the Cleavage Reagent and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes with gentle rotation. This step may be repeated to ensure complete cleavage (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n4.  **Post-Deblocking Wash**:\n    *   **Option 1.4.1**: Wash beads with 1X Binding & Washing (B&W) Buffer to remove the deblocking agent.\n        *   **Components**: Beads from the deblocking step and 1X B&W Buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n    *   **Operational Details**: A magnetic stand is used to separate the beads for 1 minute, and the deblocking buffer is removed. 1X B&W Buffer is added, beads are resuspended, separated, and the supernatant is discarded. This wash cycle is repeated 2-3 times (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n5.  **Subsequent Synthesis Cycles**: Steps 1 through 4 are repeated for each additional nucleotide according to the target sequence (Sept2025 pages 1-2). For example, to synthesize ACATGATA:\n    *   Cycle 2 (C): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dCTP (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n    *   Cycle 3 (A): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dATP (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n    *   Cycle 4 (T): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dTTP (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n    *   Cycle 5 (G): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dGTP (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n    *   Cycle 6 (A): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dATP (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n    *   Cycle 7 (T): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dTTP (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n    *   Cycle 8 (A): Use 3\u2032-ONH2-dATP (Sept2025 pages 1-2).\n\n**Chemical DNA Synthesis (Phosphoramidite Method)**\nThis method involves the sequential addition of mononucleotide synthons to a growing DNA segment covalently linked to an insoluble support, and is adaptable to automated DNA synthesis machines (Caruthers1991 pages 1-2).\n\n1.  **Support Materials**:\n    *   **Silica**: Used as an inert matrix. Deoxynucleosides are linked to silica by first forming (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (1) by refluxing with the silica matrix in dry toluene for 3 hours. Next, (2) is synthesized by reacting an appropriately protected deoxynucleoside first with succinic anhydride and then with p-nitrophenol and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Condensation of (1) with the deoxynucleoside 3'-(p-nitrophenyl succinate) (2) forms a silica-linked deoxynucleoside (3). Underivatized amino groups are blocked by acylation with acetic anhydride. The ratio of reagents is adjusted to yield approximately 50 \u00b5mol of deoxynucleoside/g of silica (Caruthers1991 pages 1-2).\n    *   **Controlled-pore glass (CPG)**: Replaced Vydac and Fractosil as the silica matrix, increasing repetitive yields by approximately 1% per cycle (Caruthers1991 pages 2-3).\n    *   **Polystyrene-divinylbenzene cross-linked polystyrene**: Can also be used, particularly supports with higher cross-linking (Caruthers1991 pages 2-3).\n2.  **Mononucleotide Synthons**: Deoxynucleoside phosphoramidites are used.\n    *   Initially, deoxynucleoside 3'-chlorophosphites (5a) and 3'-tetrazolylphosphoramidites (5b) were used but were unstable (Caruthers1991 pages 2-3).\n    *   **Deoxynucleoside 3'-N,N-dimethylphosphoramidites (5c)**: These are stable, isolated in 90-93% yield by routine aqueous extraction and precipitation from pentane. They are stable to moisture and oxidation, can be stored indefinitely as solids, and are easily activated by weak acids (e.g., tetrazole) to form (6) in 98-100% yields (Caruthers1991 pages 2-3).\n    *   **N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidite (5d)**: This has largely replaced (5c) due to better long-term storage stability (Caruthers1991 pages 2-3).\n    *   **Protecting Group (R1)**: The methyl substituent was initially used but has been replaced by the \u03b2-cyanoethyl group, which is removed under basic conditions, eliminating the need for thiophenoxide (Caruthers1991 pages 2-3).\n3.  **Synthesis Cycle (Four steps per deoxynucleotide addition)**:\n    *   **Step i: Detritylation**:\n        *   **Reagent**: Dichloroacetic acid in CH2Cl2 (1:100, v/v) (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4, Table I).\n        *   **Purpose**: Removal of the dimethoxytrityl (DMT) group from (3) to yield (4) (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4).\n        *   **Time**: 3 minutes (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4, Table I).\n        *   **Washes**: CH2Cl2 (0.5 min), acetonitrile (1.5 min), dry acetonitrile (1.5 min) (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4, Table I).\n        *   **Operational Details**: This step requires careful control as deoxyadenosine is susceptible to depurination under acidic conditions (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4).\n    *   **Step ii: Condensation (Add Nucleotide)**:\n        *   **Reagent**: Activated nucleotide (5c or 5d) in acetonitrile (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4, Table I).\n        *   **Purpose**: Condensation of (5c) or (5d) with (4) to yield (6) (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4).\n        *   **Time**: 5 minutes (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4, Table I).\n        *   **Operational Details**: For each micromole of deoxynucleoside attached covalently to silica gel, 0.1 M tetrazole (0.2 mL) and 0.1 M deoxynucleoside phosphoramidite (0.2 mL) are premixed in acetonitrile. This solution is then added to the support-bound deoxynucleoside. Yields per condensation exceed 99% (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4, Table I).\n        *   **Wash**: Acetonitrile (0.5 min) (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4, Table I).\n    *   **Step iii: Capping**:\n        *   **Reagent**: DMAP/(dimethylamino)pyridine/THF/lutidine (6:90:10, v/v/v), 0.1 mL of acetic anhydride (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4, Table I).\n        *   **Purpose**: To acylate any DNA segments (7) that failed to react during condensation and to remove deoxynucleoside phosphite adducts (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4).\n        *   **Time**: 2 minutes (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4, Table I).\n        *   **Wash**: THF/lutidine/H2O (2:2:1, v/v/v) (1 min) (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4, Table I).\n        *   **Note**: DMAP has been replaced by N-methylimidazole to reduce transition mutation frequency (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4).\n    *   **Step iv: Oxidation**:\n        *   **Reagent**: I2 solution (0.2 M iodine in THF/lutidine/H2O (2:2:1, v/v/v)) (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4, Table I).\n        *   **Purpose**: Converts the intermediate phosphite triester (6) to the phosphate triester (8) (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4).\n        *   **Time**: 1 minute (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4, Table I).\n        *   **Washes**: Acetonitrile (0.5 min), CH2Cl2 (0.5 min) (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4, Table I).\n    *   **Post-Synthesis**: After the desired sequence is synthesized, protecting groups are removed with concentrated ammonium hydroxide, and the DNA is purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or high-performance liquid chromatography (Caruthers1991 pages 3-4).\n\n### DNA Synthesis by Polymerases (General Mechanisms and Fidelity)\n\nDNA polymerases are enzymes that synthesize DNA by preferentially incorporating correct deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) over incorrect ones (Mc2008 pages 1-2).\n\n1.  **Fidelity Mechanisms**:\n    *   **Polymerase Selectivity**: The primary mechanism where the polymerase favors the incorporation of the correct dNTP (Mc2008 pages 1-2).\n    *   **Proofreading**: Many DNA polymerases possess an associated 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 exonuclease activity that excises incorrect bases from the growing DNA chain, allowing for another attempt at correct synthesis (Mc2008 pages 1-2). For example, the Klenow fragment's proofreading exonuclease activity can excise 88% of mismatched bases before polymerization (Tindall1988 pages 3-4). However, Taq DNA polymerase lacks this 3'\u21925' exonuclease activity (Tindall1988 pages 2-3, 3-4).\n    *   **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: A post-replication mechanism that monitors DNA for errors, excises the error in the newly synthesized strand, and then re-synthesizes DNA (Mc2008 pages 1-2).\n    *   These three mechanisms collectively result in an *in vivo* mutation rate estimated to be lower than 1 \u00d7 10^-9, meaning less than one error for every billion base pairs copied (Mc2008 pages 1-2).\n2.  **Misalignment-Mediated Errors**: DNA synthesis errors can arise from template-primer misalignments, leading to frame-shift mutations (nucleotide additions or deletions) or base substitutions (Kunkel1990 pages 1-2, 4-5).\n    *   **Four Pathways for Errors**:\n        *   **Pathway B (Base substitution) then BB**: Misincorporation of a nucleotide followed by extension from the mispair (Kunkel1990 pages 1-2, 4-5).\n        *   **Pathway F (Frame shift) then FF**: Template-primer slippage followed by continued polymerization, which fixes the extra nucleotide from the misaligned template-primer (Kunkel1990 pages 1-2).\n        *   **Pathway F then FB**: Template-primer slippage followed by the incorporation of a single correct nucleotide, then realignment, which generates a mispair leading to a base-substitution error. This is also known as dislocation mutagenesis (Kunkel1990 pages 1-2, 4-5).\n        *   **Pathway B then BF**: Misincorporation of a nucleotide, where if the misincorporated nucleotide is complementary to the next template nucleotide, template-primer slippage leads to a minus-one-nucleotide frame-shift error (Kunkel1990 pages 1-2).\n    *   The frequency of these errors is influenced by the DNA sequence, nucleotide composition, and the specific polymerase involved (Kunkel1990 pages 6-7).\n3.  **Specialized Synthesis Mechanisms**:\n    *   **Translesion DNA Synthesis (TLS)**: Specialized, error-prone DNA polymerases bypass DNA lesions that would otherwise impede major replicative polymerases (Livneh2010 pages 1-3, Mc2008 pages 2-3). This can involve multiple polymerases in a two-polymerase mechanism, where one polymerase inserts opposite a lesion, and another extends from the resulting primer terminus (Livneh2010 pages 1-3, Mc2008 pages 2-3). Insertion accuracy and mutagenic specificity are often determined by pol\u03b7, pol\u03ba, or pol\u03b9, while extension is primarily carried out by pol\u03b6 (Livneh2010 pages 1-3). TLS can occur at the replication fork or during gap-filling after the fork has moved (Mc2008 pages 2-3).\n    *   **Break-Induced Replication (BIR)**: A recombination-dependent DNA synthesis mechanism used to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Donnianni2013 pages 1-1). BIR initiates via Rad51-catalyzed strand invasion (Donnianni2013 pages 1-1). It proceeds through a conservative mode of DNA synthesis involving a migrating D-loop (displacement loop), where newly synthesized strands segregate with the broken chromosome (Donnianni2013 pages 1-1, 4-4, 4-5). Lagging strand synthesis initiates on the nascent displaced strand (Donnianni2013 pages 1-1, 4-4). This process requires extensive leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis (Donnianni2013 pages 1-2) and is optimal in cells released from G1 arrest (Donnianni2013 pages 1-2).\n The information has been saved to the file: Literature-1109"}
