{"content": "Based on the reagent availability check, the chemical DNA synthesis (Phosphoramidite Method) is not a viable option, as most of the required reagents are unavailable. However, the Enzymatic DNA Synthesis method can be performed since all of its key reagents are in stock.\n\nTherefore, my next step is to refine the protocol to exclusively feature the enzymatic synthesis method. I will use the `Protocol` agent for this, providing the original protocol and the reagent availability data as inputs. This will generate a clean, validated procedure that is ready for execution.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"experiment_name": "DNA synthesis", "file_ids": ["Protocol-d8cd", "Reagent-caf2"]}, "id": "call_d2b63821e8c249a296f4f59995c38d51", "type": "tool_call"}]}
