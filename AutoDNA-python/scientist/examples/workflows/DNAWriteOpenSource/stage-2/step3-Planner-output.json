{"content": "I have reviewed the literature and identified two primary methods for DNA synthesis: Enzymatic DNA Synthesis and the Phosphoramidite Method. I will start by creating a procedure for the Enzymatice DNA Synthesis method, as it appears to be the more modern and straightforward approach. The next logical step is to formulate a detailed experimental plan based on the literature. Therefore, I will use the Protocol agent to generate a precise and actionable guide for synthesizing the required DNA strands. This will ensure that the subsequent steps of reagent checking and code generation are based on a solid and well-defined experimental design.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Protocol", "args": {"experiment_name": "DNA synthesis", "file_ids": ["Literature-1109"]}, "id": "call_bc002bc30cea451da8dda7b076d4f091", "type": "tool_call"}]}
