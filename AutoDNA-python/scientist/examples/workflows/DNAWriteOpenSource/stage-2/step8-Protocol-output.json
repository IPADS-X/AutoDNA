{"content": "Part 1: Enzymatic DNA Synthesis (TdT-mediated)\n\n    Step 1.1: Perform Coupling Reaction for Nucleotide Addition\n\n        Option 1.1.1: TdT-mediated addition of a 3'-O-blocked nucleotide terminator.\n            - Component A: Immobilized initiator oligonucleotide on beads (final concentration: 1 \u00b5M)\n            - Component B: ZaTdT-R335L-K337G (final concentration: 2 mg/mL)\n            - Component C: 3\u2032-ONH2-dATP (final concentration: 0.50 mM)\n            - Component D: CoCl2 (final concentration: 0.50 mM)\n            - Component E: Phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) (final concentration: 50 mM)\n            - Component F: NaCl (final concentration: 100 mM)\n            (operational details: All components are prepared with HPLC-grade water and must be free from aldehyde/ketone contamination. The reaction mixture is incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 5 minutes with gentle tilting and rotation to keep beads suspended.)\n\n    Step 1.2: Perform Post-Coupling Wash\n\n        Option 1.2.1: Wash beads using 1X Binding & Washing (B&W) Buffer.\n            - Component A: Beads from the coupling step\n            - Component B: 1X Binding & Washing (B&W) Buffer\n                - Recipe: 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20\n            (operational details: Use a magnetic stand to separate the beads for 1 minute and remove the supernatant. Add 1X B&W Buffer, resuspend the beads, separate them again on the magnetic stand, and discard the supernatant. Repeat this wash cycle 2-3 times.)\n\n    Step 1.3: Perform Deblocking Reaction\n\n        Option 1.3.1: Cleavage of the 3\u2032-ONH2 protecting group with sodium nitrite.\n            - Component A: Washed beads from the post-coupling wash\n            - Component B: Cleavage Reagent\n                - Recipe: 700 mM NaNO2 in 1 M aqueous sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5\n            (operational details: Resuspend the beads in the Cleavage Reagent and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes with gentle rotation. This step may be repeated to ensure complete cleavage.)\n\n    Step 1.4: Perform Post-Deblocking Wash\n\n        Option 1.4.1: Wash beads using 1X Binding & Washing (B&W) Buffer.\n            - Component A: Beads from the deblocking step\n            - Component B: 1X Binding & Washing (B&W) Buffer\n                - Recipe: 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20\n            (operational details: Use a magnetic stand to separate the beads for 1 minute and remove the deblocking buffer. Add 1X B&W Buffer, resuspend the beads, separate them again, and discard the supernatant. Repeat this wash cycle 2-3 times.)\n\n    Step 1.5: Initiate Subsequent Synthesis Cycles\n\n        Option 1.5.1: Repeat synthesis cycle for the next nucleotide in the sequence.\n            - Component A: Washed, deblocked beads from previous cycle\n            - Component B: 3\u2032-ONH2-dCTP, 3\u2032-ONH2-dATP, 3\u2032-ONH2-dTTP, or 3\u2032-ONH2-dGTP (as required by the target sequence)\n            - Component C: All other components for the coupling reaction as described in Option 1.1.1.\n            (operational details: Repeat Steps 1.1 through 1.4, using the appropriate 3\u2032-ONH2-dNTP for the current position in the desired DNA sequence.)\n The validated procedure has been saved to the file: Protocol-c2dc"}
