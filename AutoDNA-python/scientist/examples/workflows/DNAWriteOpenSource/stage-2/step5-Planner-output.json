{"content": "I have generated a detailed protocol for both enzymatic and chemical DNA synthesis. To proceed, I must determine which of these methods is viable by checking the availability of the required reagents. I will now use the Reagent agent to cross-reference the reagents from my generated protocol with the lab's inventory. This step is crucial for making an informed decision on which synthesis path to pursue.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Reagent", "args": {"reagent_query_id": "Protocol-d8cd"}, "id": "call_498ca34af503488fa56a0b822891ae9f", "type": "tool_call"}]}
