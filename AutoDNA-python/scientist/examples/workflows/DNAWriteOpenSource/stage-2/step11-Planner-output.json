{"content": "I have successfully generated the Python code for the enzymatic DNA synthesis protocol. Now, it's time to execute this code to synthesize the 78 required DNA strands. I will use the `Hardware` agent to run the script. I am setting the `repeat_num` to 1 because the generated code already iterates through all 78 DNA sequences provided in the previous step. Therefore, a single execution is sufficient to synthesize all the required DNA strands.", "tool_calls": [{"name": "Hardware", "args": {"file_ids": ["Code-1aa7"], "repeat_num": 1}, "id": "call_68c1aa0894d9453c9333ce1ac4959836", "type": "tool_call"}]}
