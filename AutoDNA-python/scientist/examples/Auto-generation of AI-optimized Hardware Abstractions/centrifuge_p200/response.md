        Starts a centrifugation cycle with the specified parameters.

        This is a blocking operation; it will not return until the cycle
        is complete. The user is expected to have loaded the compatible
        8-strip tubes before calling this method.

        Based on the operating steps:
        1. Set Speed (speed_rpm)
        2. Set Duration (duration_sec)
        3. Start

            speed_rpm: The rotational speed in revolutions per minute (RPM).
